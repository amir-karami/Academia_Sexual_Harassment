"male,social&humanities,Other R1,"While an undergraduate, I was sexually assaulted by a fellow student and began an adjudication process. Part of this process was having the school's Title IX coordinator email my professors with vague details (i.e. that I was working with the office and might need some extra help and that professors should reach out to me and be flexible). I felt very lonely during this process and the professor in question emailed me offering to be a friend and ally. I desperately needed supportive people in my life and I was more than happy to try and take him up on his offer. He came on very strongly in class and in emails to me, complimenting my work endlessly. Eventually, during my senior year, he became my undergraduate thesis advisor in the department. In our meetings together he would often make strange comments about ""not wanting me to get the wrong idea."" For instance, he told me that he didn't want to shut the door when we met and that he didn't want to read more suggestive lines of my poetry out loud to me when giving critique ""in case someone walking by heard."" Also in these meetings, I would catch him looking at my chest, thighs, and other body parts in a sexualized way before averting his eyes. He told me inappropriate things about his childhood and tried to insert topics like incest into our conversations, perhaps because he had read my sexual abuse into my poetry or because he knew I was pursuing a Title IX case. He would constantly try to bring up my father or compare himself to my father (i.e. ""I know I'm not your dad, but I'm really proud of you""). He would constantly compare me to his girlfriend, later wife, and set up a meeting between us for unknown reasons. He seemed thrilled that it had gone well. He would ask me deeply personal questions about my case and my life and I would leave these meetings feeling as though I had something taken from me. He would send emails filled with winky and smiley faces. I felt unsettled by his behavior, but it wasn't until I started talking to others in the department that I learned I wasn't alone. One fellow student told me that she had quit the department because of him and that he ""loved little girls"" like me. I also found out that he had been sleeping with one of his master's students and dumped her as she was graduating. This relationship was initiated after he invited the student to go out for wine. Later, the professor shared with me the unofficial guide to grad school that he gave all hopeful MFAs. One of the pieces of advice was that ""some professors may prefer to meet over wine."" Also in the guide was a recommendation that students attend a popular writing conference so that they could ""have consensual sex with other writers ;)."" Almost every female student I knew that had taken his classes seemed to fall into his web, talking about him constantly and despairing if he criticized their work. One of these students sent the professor a very sexual poem that was explicitly about him, and instead of taking appropriate actions he sent her back an email asking not to write about him because he ""had to be careful about these things"" because he'd ""run into trouble before.""

Afterwards, while still in the classroom after class, he exploded at her, stood threateningly over her, called her a fucking bitch and left the classroom in a rage. He went to rant about the two of us in vulgar and explicit terms in front of many of our classmates on campus. This was the point at which I filed the formal complaint. I later learned he had also harassed at least four other students (which amounted to almost half of the women in our program). After four of us reported him, he continued to behave threateningly, to the point that when I talked to my female advisor about him, she said that the faculty was concerned too, but they didn't know how to handle it because they feared that if they upset him, they could have a ""Virginia Tech"" situation on their hands. She literally was scared that he would carry out a mass shooting if the faculty stood up for us."NotAvailable,NotAvailable,NotAvailable, male,social&humanities,Elite Institution/Ivy League,"An assistant professor repeatedly came to my office to talk to me in front of my officemates.

"male,social&humanities,Other R1,"In the middle of a class discussion on early 20th century sociology, the professor proclaimed to the entire class that I was sexy, despite my being ""older than the rest"" of the students. This prof revels in his ""academic rebel"" persona and enjoys making outrageous/heavy-handed and un-PC remarks, often calling out students and engaging them in silly/ridiculous conversation related to some personal characteristic (name, state or country of origin, family status, religion, hobbies, etc.). Usually it's all in good fun, but slightly uncomfortable/awkward. This was the first time (in this class), however, he made a comment toward anyone that was sexual in nature. I was so shocked that I gasped and laughed in surprise, but after the shock passed, really resented that he verbalized the idea that I'm some hottie Latina MILF. I believe the professor actually thought he was complimenting me, however, now I always wonder what other students/faculty think of me, and whether my intellectual credibility is overshadowed by my appearance/ethnicity. I feel I constantly have to overcompensate intellectually while repressing personal expression to counteract any stereotypes that were raised/reinforced by that comment. It's exhausting."male,social&humanities,Other R1,"Jan 20, 2008 I was in a shared graduate student office late at night, I asked a fellow grad student if he would be staying late and, if so, if he could walk me to my bike otherwise I would leave early. He said he was planning to stay late and agreed to walk me to my bike. These are my notes from the incident: I finished reading a little after 10pm and as I started packing up * sparked up a conversation about his loneliness and his relationship status. He confessed that he was reading a self-help book about relationships because he felt really lonely and couldn_验t figure out how to meet someone. He mentioned that in the book he was reading the author said that women immediately knew whether or not they would sleep with a man upon meeting him. He then proceeded to ask me about my relationships. He asked me if I had ever had a one night stand and I said no. He said he couldn_验t believe it and said that he had slept with a lot of virgins_延that these young women would pick him out, in a club, for example, and ask to sleep with him. I told him I found it odd and unbelievable. I can_验t recall the exact details of the conversation at this point, but I do know that as he continued to ask me about my relationships and the role that sex played in my relationships.At one point * suddenly asked me _岩Do you want to fuck?_ I said _岩No, I would never sleep with you._ He said _岩Well, when I look at you I want to fuck you. When you look at me do you want to fuck me?_I repeated myself, _岩No, I would never sleep with you._He acted shocked. He told me something along the lines of _岩I can fuck for hours._ He also told me that his room was nearby. I told him _岩You_验re being really creepy ***,_ because by this point the entire tone of the conversation had changed dramatically, and I was startled and afraid. Although he denied that he was acting creepy, I repeated myself. I called his behavior creepy at least 4 times and he asked me to stop saying it. He said something like _岩That_验s the kind of thing you say about criminals_ (he might have said _岩__about a molester_ I can_验t remember exactly). He was visibly upset by my comment.As I was sitting down printing, *** positioned himself standing behind me and asked me _岩What kind of panties are you wearing?_ I told him to stop, and that he was really creeping me out. I was really afraid that I was alone with him and I would have to walk outside to get my bike and that he might hurt me. In an effort to direct the conversation, once again, toward his inappropriate behavior, I started a conversation about how he related to woman in the history department. I told him that I thought he had problems communicating with women and that other women in the department had mentioned as much. I told him that a couple of women had complained to me that he didn_验t acknowledge them or say hello, and that in this instance, when he was actually talking to one of his female colleagues, his behavior had become inappropriate very quickly. He got defensive again and told me that he always tried to be very objective and that he wanted people to think of him as such, and that perhaps he was misunderstood. I told him that, on the contrary, he wasn_验t objective at all; that he was one of the most dogmatic people I knew and that other people in the department might agree with me. At this point we were walking outside and I had already picked up my bike. He told me that the reason he didn_验t acknowledge women or even say hello to them was because his aunt had told him that, as a man, any little thing you do_延even looking at a woman the wrong way_延might be misinterpreted as sexual harassment. I discovered that another female graduate student had also been sexually harassed by *** who had been assigned as her mentor in the department.

This now former professor has been able to bury the case and tell others that he did not know this undergraduate sexual partner was his bio-daughter and/or that it is entirely fabricated. When the case broke it was only picked up by the alt-right press, Rush Limbaugh, etc., but it was not followed up by the New York Times or other legitimate media outlets, perhaps because this professor was well connected, and the few of us who knew what happened did not want to cause more hurt for his relations--the daughter, the mother of the daughter, his wife, his other children, his parents and family. He also enjoyed the lucky break that the bio daughter had a different last name than his--his name is not on her birth certificate. What was the upshot? it took years for his department (different department than mine) to let him go. What happened to the daughter, her bio-mother, and her extended family was devastating. I am reporting this because it was completely totally buried and had a traumatic impact on many who have had to work with this man. This Ivy is notorious for sexual harassment; friends and colleagues have identified their rapists on the faculty, but nothing is done. This professor may have faced more serious ramifications--when the Manhattan DA charged him, he agreed to a misdemeanor plea and eventually was removed from the faculty. The willingness of others to believe that he was an innocent or ignore it is appalling. I am reporting this because this level of sexual impropriety/harassment/assault (whatever you would choose to call it) happens in large part because others are ultimately complicit.

It turns out that I was applying to the same graduate school and program where he had been studying. This is where things started to intensify over the next couple of months.

It began casually enough, with comments about the kinds of women he finds attractive (followed by a string of adjectives that more or less describe me), questions about my dating history, and comments that men must show interest in me often. It developed into specific comments (So-and-So must have hit on you when you were working at X (other) site) and suggestions about exercises I could perform in order to, for example, improve my bust (his word, not mine). All of the comments came when no one else was within hearing distance. He would make ""jokes"" about being heartbroken and suicidal that I wouldn't follow him home and would hold my writing implements hostage so I would have to talk to him in order to get them back (I avoided him otherwise). He carved my name onto an ancient artifact (HIGHLY inappropriate, regardless of what you carve on there). I spoke with the site director about my discomfort and he spoke with the Offender, but things escalated. He kept asking me for drinks after dinner and, during a social event, pressed his body against mine and only backed off when a (male) colleague entered the scene. Finally I addressed the issue with the Offender myself, at which point he told me that I only said I was uncomfortable because I felt threatened in my authority in MY trench I asked for clarification on this comment three times, to be sure that I didn't misunderstand him.

Most of the young women were from cultures where such contact with a man would have been shaming, and so they were reluctant to report and none would charge him in court.

Finally, the psychological toll (not to mention the toll this all took on my work) of being shunned by my only social network (my colleagues) was so severe, I agreed to reconcile with my ex and we dated for another year before he accepted a post-doc and I was able to get away from him.

They revealed that I was the person who had reported it. The institution responded to the whole mess by making everyone in that program go through mandatory harassment training the following year - but since the harasser was a guest professor he did not go through it. He returned to campus AGAIN the following year and someone had told him that I was the person who reported it. He cornered me in the stacks of the library and asked for my forgiveness, weeping outright about how ""forgiveness is such a beautiful thing"" and (irrelevantly) telling me all about how his father was a cruel man who had interrogated Nazis.

It emerged that this same professor had been so irritated by the proposal of a program in Women's and Gender Studies years early that he had put together a satirical proposal for a ""Fat People Studies"" and submitted it to the university.

He (tenured, MAJOR figure in my field) started talking to me about professional field-related stuff. But then he somehow maneuvered me into a corner of this boat, isolated from the rest of the tour group. While continuing to hold a professional conversation -- in fact, to top it off, he was giving me job market advice-- he kept getting more and more in my personal space, and I found myself literally holding my heavy bag across my chest just to create some kind of barrier. Then I felt his knee first graze mine at first and then pass across my knee so that it was between my knees. First I froze. I mean, broad daylight, conference event, I honestly for a split second assumed he'd lost his footing (we were on a boat), and this was a total accident on his part. Then I realized he was silent, smirking down at me and his knee was now working on parting my knees. I muttered something along the lines of needing to go, I honestly don't remember what. He leaned away from me with a look of disappointment and said, ""I guess you're not interested?"" I goggled at him and fled. That night, at the conference reception, he continued following me around trying, repeatedly, to strike up conversations with me, drunk by this point. My male grad school friends, informed of the situation, started repeatedly rescuing me, God bless them, but then he would just sit and, very drunk by this point, stare at me lasciviously from across the space, and I mean, fixedly stare. I have since learned, through sharing my story on the whisper network, that he has harassed numerous young women in academia in this and other manners, but, guess what, he is the first on academic social media to express horror before the latest sexual harassment scandal. At a conference since that fateful one, I overheard him loftily saying that sexual harassers should receive no mercy and be outed publicly for their actions. For the life of me, I don't get it. Is this complete hypocrisy, a total disconnect from reality, or, worse, is his definition of harassment full-on sexual assault, while non-consensually putting your knee between a young woman's knees at a conference event is what, his understanding of casual flirting?

He verbally threatened me and suggested the new chair (whom I admired) would have problems with me and I should not be on her bad side--another threat. Indeed, after whatever he communicated to her she did not speak to me for more than six months and described him as her friend several times. I heard informally I was being 'trashed' by the associated personnel. I was a first year PhD student. I later heard my project, which moved outside university facilities, became infamous though I actually did it in order to be far away from him and from his colleagues.

"female,social&humanities,Elite Institution/Ivy League,"During the first year of my graduate program, I separated from my emotionally abusive husband and entered into a new romantic relationship with a fellow graduate student. I am a relatively private person, and as such, kept many of the details to myself as a way of coping with my impending divorce and continued emotional coercion and abuse from my husband. During that time, the fellow graduate students in my cohort (both male and female) bombarded me with questions about my separation and my new relationship, including intimate, detailed questions about my sex life. When I politely declined to share this information, members of my cohort spread malicious, speculative rumors about my sexual history and the current state of my sex life. These rumors not only circulated among graduate students, but also spread to members of faculty, including the professor I worked for as an R.A. Two male graduate students contacted my estranged husband to fill him on the rumors they had heard about my sex life, sparking an escalation of my husband's continued threats and abuse. The professor I worked for an an R.A. approached the graduate student I was then in a relationship with to admonish my partner for entering into a relationship with a ""married woman."" During admitted students weekend, rumors about my sex life were also spread to many of the prospective graduate students who came to visit the campus. Needless to say, my reputation as a slut, alongside detailed and highly exaggerated if not outright false rumors of my sex life persisted throughout the rest of my time in the program. New graduate students I'd never met approached me while drunk to say that they'd heard I was into ""threesomes"" or that they'd been warned off from talking to me because I might try to ""break up"" their relationships. After being given a desirable teaching assignment by our course coordinator, I found out the director of my graduate program had chosen to strip both me and my partner from teaching the advanced course. When I approached the director to ask why we had both been demoted in terms of teaching assignments, the professor claimed that she'd made the decision based on our relationship status. Needless to say, the explanation made no sense and was beyond unprofessional and inappropriate. Just before graduating from the program, I discovered that this same professor had, at one point, invited fellow graduate students over to her house, at which time she had engaged in spreading false rumors about me that she had heard from former students. When I again approached this professor about her unprofessional behavior, she claimed that she was not responsible for verifying rumors before discussing them with my fellow graduate students.

He's made multiple comments about my physical appearance, including one recent incident when he asked how a guest lecture went and when I said I thought it went well and that students were responsive and participatory, he said, ""well, that's only because you're pretty."" I have Hershey's Kisses in my office and he kept asking if he could have a kiss, but kept saying it in a creepy way and then made suggestive comments about it afterward.

And the work was easy. Then out of nowhere, he started referring to me as ""Babe"" in emails. For example: ""Okay, babe"". I worked in computer tech support at the same university and I had three male bosses whom I trusted. I told all of them about this incident, showed them emails, and asked them what I should do. Their response was: ""I'm not sure"". This professor brought in a lot of money and I think they were afraid to rock the boat.

This was someone who I had been attracted to for several years but I never, ever entertained the idea of having a crush on her, let alone pursuing a relationship with her. At first I thought it was all in my head: _岩there_验s no way that this woman is flirting with me, am I insane?_ (In hindsight, I can now see how head games were a central component of the manipulation that would follow). I had had a particularly rough few years in graduate school, which included an antagonistic working relationship with one of my committee members and messy boundaries between myself and my dissertation advisor (who I frequently offered emotional and logistical support to as she endured a personal crisis of her own). I think that the dynamics I had with these two other faculty members contributed to me being in an unusually precarious and vulnerable position as a grad student, which is why I found it exciting and flattering to have a faculty member shower positive, flirtatious attention on me. I somehow got it in my head that I should ask her out on a date. To my surprise, she said yes. And that was the start of what would turn out to be an extremely tumultuous relationship that lasted about a year, followed by another year of emotional abuse. While the relationship started out great, magical even, it quickly became volatile and emotionally abusive. It would take me a long time to connect the dots and realize that I might have been preyed upon. For example, long after the relationship ended I was looking at an old text message exchange we had before we had even gone out on our first date. In the text exchange she mentioned that she was trying to ease her conscience by reviewing every email she had ever sent me (before I asked her out). Naive as I was, I asked why she would do that. She replied by saying that she was trying to see if she had been unprofessional at any point (i.e. if there had been any written evidence of her flirtation). She concluded that the emails showed that she had just been warm and supportive, and proclaimed: ""So it_验s on you._ Later on I would learn that I was not the first student that she had had a relationship with. She had dated another student at a previous institution. And the MO was the same: he had asked her out. I suppose _岩it_ (the responsibility? the transgression?) was on him, too__After a tumultuous year-long affair, she broke up with me and I was utterly heartbroken. This also coincided with me taking a postdoc on the other side of the country, which has lead me to endlessly wonder: did she dump me because the relationship was toxic and that was the benevolent thing to do? Or did she dump me because I wasn_验t willing to sacrifice my career so that I could stay near her? There was a brief attempt to rekindle things long distance, until out of nowhere she ghosted on me. At the same time, her phone would (mysteriously, conveniently) butt dial me every week for about 2 months. When I confronted her about it in a text message, she gaslit me and tore me a new one. This is just one example of the kind of catch-and-release manipulation that characterized our interactions.

I know of five others (students and staff) who have similar stories but who will not go forward with them because of the school's lack of response to the reported stories.

I feared that he would no longer support me if I went against his wishes. At the same time, I worried that people I respected, including my committee members, would denigrate me and my work if it were known that I had had sexual intercourse with him. I took on the situation as my own psychologically, and continue to suffer deep emotional trauma from this experience. I later ended up working with this same professor post-graduation on a major research project, and while I had made clear that I was not interested in any sexual relationship with him, he proceeded to engage in aggressive sexual harassment and sexual assault in his role as my supervisor. Once I settled into the job, he began to routinely grope me at work. He put his hands on my breast and/or genitals whenever he could manage it. He regularly commented on my body, shape, size, and sex appeal. He has verbally and physically threatened to rape me on several occasions. At each meeting with him, I anticipate I will be subject to some sort of sexual abuse or public ridicule because of my gender, but he is my supervisor, letter writer, and a giant in my field. This harassment is on-going and while I want to file a complaint with my university, I have been told by many colleagues and other women he has abused that the university does not care about me/us; it will always protects its cherished professors. And I have watched closely as other complaints of sexual harassment and assault are poorly handled by my university -- and how each time the accuser lost and the accused, often a professor, was unharmed.

By spring of my first year, I was the youngest assistant stage manager in the dept_验s history attributed to my prior experience, enrolled in 22 credits (mostly theater), and basically in the department 9-12 hours a day/6 days a week. Because of my involvement in the show, the other faculty in the production also had my personal contact info (phone, room number, etc.). The stage crew director (faculty member) began texting me seemingly innocent enough about show related things, but it quickly escalated to pressuring me to spend time with him outside of work related things. He also taught one of my classes, and would come up behind me and rub my back. I would shake him off and he_验d come back the next class. He touched other girls too, rubbing their backs. I was 17, having started college young, and I was glad to be in this show and out in a big city on my own. But I did know his actions were wrong. I first told a senior in the department how uncomfortable he made me, and she said he had a reputation for that behavior and she would try to watch my back and deflect him. That worked for the physical touch but didn_验t stop the texts and calls at night. I kept saying no. Finally grades came out at my marks were far lower than any contributing assignment_验s marks would have led me to anticipate. I had been a high school valedictorian (weighted). I was pissed. I went to the show_验s director in tears and asked how this could happen (showing high marks consistently on grades). He told me he didn_验t believe in grades anyway and that if I cared about my grades, this department wasn_验t for me. He didn_验t acknowledge he objective discrepancy at all. I spoke with the female department chair and she said (and I_验ll never fucking forget it): _岩you_验re young, sure, but you can_验t honstly tell me you didn_验t know what you needed to do to get a good grade from him!_ I walked out sobbing while she laughed. I left the major and didn_验t look back. In the two years that followed, many of my friends from the department shared similar stories with me, and nothing changed. Finally, in my final year, one of my close friends from the theater dept became Miss Maryland and was on the TLC show and became a local celeb, especially for the small college where I was. She had been harassed by him consistently and raised the issue (using her newfound platform) to the university level administration. Within the semester, he was gone. The next semester spring before I graduated I was funneled into a 1:1 advising meeting for competitive graduate scholarships with a memeber of the university president_验s office. I told her why that one semester_验s grades were so bad that it took me from summa cum laude to magma cum laude (basically killing any chance for these kinds of scholarships). Her response: _岩well if your grades were that important to you, you should have left the dept when you thought the teacher would jeopardize that._ I_验d been in performing arts for almost a decade by the time I started college, and I have never done it since. I loved our school, but the whole experience was a huge black cloud. Oh, and as if that weren_验t enough, I was in ***_验s book like almost every other girl I knew. I didn_验t remember the interaction with him that led to my entry in his journal. But I think the university_验s whole non-handling of that situation was pretty egregious.

"male,social&humanities,Small Liberal Arts College,"2011: Prof said he really felt that he could 'get close' to me and suggested that we hang out 'on the down low', multiple times"male,social&humanities,Elite Institution/Ivy League,"A mentor paid ambiguous and uncomfortable amount of time and energy on me that felt like (but was never articulated) a bid for a relationship. I worked for him as a teaching and research assistant. In thanks for my hard work, he took me out to dinner at a restaurant well beyond my means. As a private pilot, he also, for ostensibly other reasons, took me out for a day in his plane. I was too young to know how to decline or to determine whether I was making too much of his advances. I was quite alright, in the end. He never forced the issue and remained supportive of my work and career until his death. It was less of a physical attack and more of an emotional toll too heavy for a young academic worrying about her career, her status, appropriate responses, image in the department, real motivations, etc. In context, this mentor was a serial husband. He had 7 marriages by the time he died. I am quite unscathed, in the long run, and he was a very good mentor otherwise. But, I learned a lot that has prevented me from being in situations that would have likely turned out quite worse."male,social&humanities,Small Liberal Arts College,"I had an emotionally abusive relationship with my dissertation advisor that ultimately involved sexual harrasment. All throughout my time in the program he would alternate between extravagant praise and career-threating criticism (like failing me in my qualifying exams and not accepting chapters of my dissertation), and with every conflict I would seek to end the relationship and ask my second reader, a woman, to direct my dissertation instead. She would always refuse because she thought it would ""look bad,"" and intercede with my director, and the next round would start all over again; I would be the golden child until the moment I was totally inept and wrong and had no business being in a doctoral program. The roots of the dynamic all became clear to me when I came out as transgender and transitioned male-to-female in 1992 right at the end of my graduate program. I had been afraid that if I came out too soon my advisor would find a way to deny me the degree I had worked so hard for. Even though I had started living socially as the person I considered myself to be about a year earlier, and was taking hormones, I was not out in my doctoral program. I finished and filed the dissertation under my old name/gender, and the second I was notified that the degree had been award I went back to my committee to have the title page amended to reflect my new name. I got the other two signatures first, then went to my advisor's house to have him sign it as well. I decided that a quick approach was best. When asked what I needed, I said simply ""Let me cut to the chase. I'm transsexual and changing my sex. I need you to sign a new title page for me."" I already had pen and page in hand, handed him both, and got the signature before he had time to really process anything. But as soon as he signed, he started literally panting and grunting with emotion, and said ""Ugh, umm, ahh, I...I have long considered you a rather attractive young woman."" He asked me if I went to sex parties and did party drugs and if so could I maybe invite him some time or score something? All the years of emotional whiplash became instantly clear. He had been hot for me but because he understood me to be a guy he hadn't come on to me, just punished me for being the object of his repressed homosexual desire, but now that he could consider me a woman, it was suddenly ""hey baby how 'bout it?"" He offered me money ""on retainer"" to buy drugs. I took his money, walked out of the room, never spoke to him again, never asked him for anything let alone a letter of recommendation, never tried to publish my dissertation, never tried seriously to get a job in the academy until I had built up a new field of expertise in another discipline--that took me another seventeen years. Being inappropriately sexualized by a person in a position of power over me totally affected my life and career-path. I've always been reluctant to share this story publicly, mostly because the conflict didn't involve physical contact, just emotional twistedness, and would be just a she said/he said thing. My advisor has long since retired. Thank you for the opportunity to add my voice and story to this cultural moment. "male,NotAvailable,Elite Institution/Ivy League,"Too many individual incidents to recount so I'll focus on one: In grad school a professor made multiple inappropriate comments about women in the women's history class she was teaching. All the students in this relatively small class were women. Most were straight, some were queer. The professor self identified as a lesbian, and would talk about her sexuality in mildly inappropriate ""joking"" ways in class and in office hours to ""test the water"" with individual students, even though she was in a committed long term relationship. She would often ask us about our sexual relationships with other women, and if two of us talked to each other outside class and she saw us, she'd assume we were sleeping together and would question us about it. The worst remarks I recall her making in class were when she joked about ""pimping us all out,"" going so far as to name the nearby street where she envisioned turning us out as prostitutes. Most of us laughed nervously, a few people rolled their eyes or murmured in protest. She pretended these were ""just jokes"" but it was clearly giving her pleasure to abuse her power in this way--she enjoyed making us feel uncomfortable. She harassed the straight women in class incessantly. When she found out I was queer she backed off a little on me--I think she was afraid that if a queer woman reported her for sexual harassment it would have more weight. She didn't harass the other out queer woman in class much either. Or maybe she was just afraid that a queer woman might be more likely to report her."male,social&humanities,Elite Institution/Ivy League,"A male graduate student, more junior than me, repeatedly slid pornography under the door to my apartment.

I knew that _岩private meetings_ with him had been occasions for various forms of browbeating and manipulation for other women. Thus, I spent the remainder of the semester insisting I was too busy to meet with him and begging for a paper topic. Finally, realizing that if I failed to write a paper because I had no assigned topic I could be flunked, I explained my dilemma to another (legitimately) advanced student and asked her to share her topic with me, adding I would do my own research and inevitably produce results different from her own so there should be no question of plagiarism. She agreed. I thoroughly researched and carefully wrote my paper, vowing not to complain as long as the professor gave me a grade of B or above. Less than that and I felt confident my complaint would be taken seriously by the committee on faculty conduct, as I was a well-known, well-liked student with an excellent academic record who was also one of the leaders of the campus black student organization.

He is now a tenured professor at a respected university.It is hard to explain how insidious this man's actions are. I first met him in my first year of graduate school, when he briefly dated a friend of mine. He was extremely full of himself, and when I saw him now and then at school events, he was one of those awful men who made long-winded comments in the Q & A. But I really only got to know him when I was inducted into the fellowship, and he targeted me.Every year, he has this habit of identifying the newest, prettiest women, and he follows them around flirting/insulting them. At the fellowship meeting that first year, as I asked this (married) professor for advice about the job market, he would sprinkle in little comments like ""If only I had met you earlier..."" I was initially flattered, but over time I began to see that it was a ritual. The last time I attended, he (and a few other senior male colleagues) latched onto a beautiful graduate student. When he is in this predatory mode, he will come over and put an arm around your shoulders or a hand on your waist. He will get in your personal space, and treat it like a game when you try to rebuff him.I graduated, moved on to my postdoc, and one year into it, he became a visiting scholar at the same institution. In fact, he was put at the next desk over. He was always leaning around the partition to bother me, and there was always a sexual undertone. This is where it gets harder to pin down though. The only specific incident that I can remember is when we were talking to a couple of other people and I said something about a box, and he gave suggestive look a look and said ""Your BOX?"" It was things like that. Always bringing it back to sex, when we were in our WORKPLACE. And then when it was about work, such as at my public lecture, he would tell people behind my back about how unoriginal my ideas were or how unconvincing my argument was.I complained about him so much that after I left the postdoc, my boyfriend (now husband) encouraged me to unfriend him on Facebook. That was liberating, even though he made comments about it at the next annual meeting.I knew I wasn't the only one who felt this way (the mere mention of his name often elicits an eye roll), but I was surprised when a friend at another school brought him up this fall (pre-Harvey Weinstein). She was a graduate student a few years before me, and she'd had the same experience. We had been talking about inappropriateness from male colleagues in general, and she said something like, ""Well, you-know-who is the worst."" I suddenly though, Yeah, isn't it a problem that all of these women have felt threatened by him?I know you will hear much worse stories, but this type of sexual harassment is completely pervasive and undermines our careers. It is men treating women as sexual objects rather than colleagues. It doesn't matter what you wear or how you act. These men perpetuate an uncomfortable atmosphere for women, make us insecure about our self-image and our accomplishments, and have the power to pass on their opinions to others."male,social&humanities,Other R1,"My story is trivial, but I suspect it's a window into something bigger. When I was an undergraduate, my campus hosted a very small literary studies conference. I worked as a conference volunteer. A visiting presenter, a senior faculty member from another institution, seemed to take a special interest in my work. His attention was very flattering until, when we were alone, he invited me back to his hotel room to ""hang out."" I came up with various excuses as he persisted. After he finally gave up, he ignored me for the rest of the conference except for making one slightly disparaging comment in front of other professors. I'm not even sure whether to call it sexual harassment, but it was certainly inappropriate behavior that spoiled the rest of the conference for me."male,social&humanities,Regional Teaching College,"Where to begin?! I am choosing to include a professional music festival in the definition of academy because I attended for work purposes to collaborate and bond with peer musicians. I met a friend and collaborator at a professional music festival in the summer of 2014. The following summer, he contacted me saying he would be passing through my part of the country; he lives in New York but had a residency in Wyoming, just an hour north of my tourist destination in Colorado. He asked if he could sleep on my couch for a weekend and sight see. I happily obliged. We were encouraged by our festival staff to stay in touch for collaborative purposes, and he and I had worked on a new music commission together previously. Rather immediately after I drove an hour to pick him up from his residency, he made small talk about sex, which made me uncomfortable. But I thought, we are supposed to be peers, friends, mature adults... If he feels like discussing his sex life, I'll accommodate him, but I won't discuss mine. He emphasized his open relationship with his girlfriend back home. Without wanting to feed my own ego, I kept fighting the nagging feeling that he was discussing this to set us up for a hook up later. The day went on with dinner and other sight seeing, and all the while I felt inexplicably uncomfortable. That night, I tried to be a basic, good host by putting on some Netflix. I sat on the opposite end of the couch. I could feel him inching closer. Before it could get more awkward, and all the while doubting he'd do anything and that I'm just assuming he's coming close because I have an ego, I got up to leave. I said, ""I'm going to bed. Do you have everything you need?"" He made me feel weird - ""Is something wrong? Why did you get up all of a sudden?"" I told him nothing, just tired, do you need anything, etc. I went to bed. He then made loud noises - absolutely slamming cabinet doors, knocking wine bottles over, uncontrollably high from his local souvenirs. I returned to the living room to ask ""Is everything okay?"" He took this as me wanting attention from him, rather than me being perturbed that he's so loud and disrespectful. ""Why do you keep checking on me?"" I told him he's being loud, and my roommate - a young cousin of mine who I'm protective of - is trying to sleep. This happened twice more. After going to bed a third time, I heard him knock on my door and whisper my name. He tried to enter. I got up to greet him - ""What do you need?"" Rather than answer, he said ""Why do you keep asking me that? Do you want to hang out?"" I told him no. He tried to enter many more times that night. I slept with a can of hair spray. This grey area was so uncomfortable. This was supposed to be a friendly weekend hosting a professional peer on my sofa, but the following morning, I lied and told him I had too much graduate school homework to focus, so I paid for him to get an Airbnb and stay somewhere else. I asked friends for advice. Some said that simply by turning on Netflix I led him on. I highly disagree. I know I was a bit cold and professional. Others said this was inexcusable. This was supposed to be a professional peer. Why did this happen? Anytime I see someone who resembles him, I actually get scared. He even ""liked"" my ""Me Too"" statuses about sexual harassment awareness. I hate this incident. The grey area matters too."male,social&humanities,Other R1,"I work in instructional technology.

We were all considered ""fellows"" - not staff and students, due to a wide range of ages. Some participants were post-doctoral and nearly the same age as staff who are professors back home. We were there to create new music together as composers and instrumentalists. My instrument group - saxophonists - happened to be comprised of some of America's top performing individuals, so I was excited to collaborate and even bond with them while in Italy. However, being the only girl, I often felt left out. I would go to dinner with them in the evenings, but they would spend this time talking about their sex lives. Not just open, healthy sex talk - talk ALWAYS defined by women being stupid, objectified, and/or demeaned. I cannot emphasize this point enough. Perhaps I was prude - I don't believe so - but even if I weren't, this was not healthy sex talk. Example: ""This girl at a party made a racist statement toward me, but it was okay because I got her drunk and she showed me her boobs. So who won? Me.""""This girl was so stupid. She thought I wanted a relationship, so I let her think it until i'd had enough sex, then just stopped texting her.""Worse still was the constant explicit commentary on staff members' bodies. Two of the women staffing the festival were my professors back home, both modest, respectable, and world renowned in their fields. Comments I heard regularly were ""I wish I could see up her skirt when she bends down"", and ""I'd pee in her butt."" You heard me right. This kind of stuff is hilarious to these guys, but it's so non-consensual on the part of the women! They are there to be respected! The men staffing the festival have none of these problems at all. Also, as a woman, I could literally break down how respected and listened to I was based on whether or not I wore makeup. These were sweltering days in Italy with no breeze or ice in drinks, so I often skipped makeup to avoid itchy skin. Male peers literally ignored me when I spoke. When I wore makeup, they listened intently without processing what I was saying. Lastly, there was an evening where I was with these male peers on a mission to buy a bottle of wine. They told me to ""flirt"" to get a discount. The wine shop owner was a bald middle-aged man. I jokingly said I would, but when I turned around, my friends were gone and I was alone with this man. I actually got scared and emerged - drunk from our earlier dinner - only to be made a total fool in front of professors while my peers told my staff I was drunk and flirting. I had actually been quite scared.I hated this experience. I paid way too much money with hopes of ultimate professional collaboration in a dream setting, my first chance meeting fellows from the nation's top music academies, only to have this define my experience. "male,social&humanities,Elite Institution/Ivy League,"When I was 19, I took an introductory English major course taught by a tenured male professor. I learned throughout the semester that the professor had a poor reputation because of his stringent guidelines and arbitrary grading practices; but I was unaware of his history of sexual misconduct with students--until I became the target of that harassment. Though some of his comments throughout the semester were off-color, I tended to ignore it. But, one day, I wore a gray dress to his class, an anomaly for me as I favor pants and more casual clothes. The dress set him off. He exclaimed that it was nice to see me dressing that way; but that he wished I wore more colors (I tend to dress monochromatically in blacks and grays) and that, given my complexion (I am Mexican-American) I would look particularly good in pastel colors. He then proceeded to derail class discussion in favor of polling my classmates about whether or not they thought I would look better in pinks and purples and more lady-like clothing. If they chose not to answer, he forced them to. Many of my male classmates eagerly participated. I remember explaining to him that my sartorial choices were based on my disdain for traditionally feminine colors and that, as a former dancer, I'd worn enough brightly colored dresses to last a lifetime. That was the wrong thing to say. He became enamored of my past as a ballerina, a fascination that continued when he enrolled his young daughter in a beginning dance class I taught in town--a class that I taught while wearing a leotard and tights. Though he did not harass me at my workplace, his snide comments on my appearance and clothing continued in class. For instance, I wore a bandana in my hair one day (think Rosie the Riveter) and he told me I looked like a ""feminazi"". Because I had to deal with him long after I completed his class (because I taught his daughter dance), I was always on guard. The last time I heard from him, he messaged me on my personal Facebook page (we are, obviously, not Facebook friends but have mutual friends on Facebook apparently) to explain that he is ""proud of me"" for my accomplishments as a graduate student.

He invited them to his hotel room. When they declined, he said ""Are you going to make me finish myself?"" He sent detailed, X-rated messages about what he would do to them. When they asked, ""Don't you have a wife and newborn child back home?"" he replied, ""Let me worry about that."" This man knows these women are his students' ages and that they're there for professional networking. This enraged me. Nothing came of it.

It turns out that he was dating the woman he would later marry at the same time he was touching me in his office. I have no idea if she knows, but I know people at the magazine knew because another woman who worked there full time walked in on him, half dressed, and me, fully dressed, and she never said anything. This was a situation from which I could not escape. For years, I continued to rely on this man's guidance in the field, and he continued to take advantage of my admiration of him and his work.

He responded ""wow! I love it when women say that to me!"" I rebuked him, saying ""Dr. XXX, I emailed you about teaching.

Met with only one other student very quickly before me and then met with me.-He closed his office door. He sat on his couch and invited me to sit down also, and then he sat in closer proximity to me; often would touch my arm/elbow for longer than a second-He turned off the light, and the door was locked from the outside. I know this because he went to talk to someone he heard in the hallway and then came back and had to unlock the door.-After we discussed poems until around 8pm, he said he wanted to ""stop work stuff"" and then asked me about how I was doing and I told him I had developed a repetitive stress injury; he was overly sympathetic and suddenly leaned in close to me and ran his hand slowly down my arm, starting from my shoulder. We both quickly pretended like nothing just happened.-Later, after he told me about his trip to the east coast, he began wrapping up our conversation, and, while still sitting near me on the couch, he asked for a hug. Although I did not want one, I was afraid to say no so I did not protest. He made it longer and closer than necessary and his left hand touched down my side and waist and lingered. I just turned away very quickly as soon as I had moved away and averted my eyes and he had jumped to behind his desk and continued conversation as if nothing had happened.-He asked me to meet with him again before I was gone/post graduating so that I may say goodbye-He told me he really enjoyed our sessions, and so I told him our sessions were ""helpful,"" and he said if they were ""merely helpful"" then his _岩feelings were hurt._ I did not respond-He talked about how he ""tailors his pedagogical relationships with his students to best fit their needs"" as if to explain what was happening and then began talking about ""transference"" in an indirect way-I felt very shocked and uncomfortable afterward; told three people close to me right away and my main thesis adviser within a week-------In addition, he tried to kiss a friend of mine after meeting her for casual drinks after she had graduated.

There are two parts to this: what I heard, and what I personally experienced/observed. What I heard was that he was a creep and a lech who used office hours to get undergraduates in his office and onto a couch-bed he kept there; that the departmental parties at his house were ""wild"" and involved drinking, drugs, some nudity, and sexual harassment of women students who attended. The class I took was not the only class he taught. He was said to have taken pictures of his wife on the toilet, and to have shown them at some of these parties. There were specific instances given which, 45 years later, I can't recall clearly enough, but I was told that some women dropped a class, or even dropped out. I do remember being warned that he liked to use the ""You're not a prude, are you?"" mode of persuasion (this being the early 70s, it worked on too many young women.) And he had a habit of locking his office door if the student gave him a chance.What I observed: In our lab sessions (when we dissected flowers under the microscope to identify the species) was that he liked to roam around ""helping"" students, and often touched them on the back or shoulder; the male students got a pat; the women students got a squeeze on the shoulder and he was clearly looking down their fronts, not at the specimens. We had graduate student T.A.s, both in the lab and on the field trips (out to various sites to collect native plant material for identification.) I found it easy to avoid touch in the lab and on the field trips, and did not attend any departmental parties at his house.What I experienced: I was an older student, with a history degree (Rice U.) and military experience behind me--and I was married. Also I was then tall and very fit, less than a year off active duty. So although I was propositioned and lightly insulted, I had been forewarned and also had resources he would not expect. It did not affect me as much as it would have a younger, more vulnerable person. I needed to ask him a question about an upcoming field trip and went to his office during office hours. I stood back from his desk, between him and the unlocked door. The setup in his office was as described: a low bed against the wall to the left (he had a big office, as befitted his academic rank) covered in a quilt, with pillows making it a plausible couch, with a bead curtain in front of it, held back partway on the sides. Very harem-inspired. He got up from his desk and approached, suggested that I ""get comfortable"" on the couch so we could discuss the field trip. I declined. He said ""You're not a prude are you? What, you think I might attack you or something?"" I said ""No, I'm married,"" and he immediately said ""You're not going to let that stop you..."" and did the raking head to toe survey with a long pause at my (then small but not invisible through my shirt ) frontage. ""And I'm an ex-Marine,"" I said, giving him a firm look. He puffed up and changed color and I repeated my question about the field trip schedule (one had been re-scheduled due to weather) and he answered sounding angry. I left, convinced that the rumors I'd heard had been true, and that if I'd been younger and without the military experience, I'd have been struggling to get out from under him. It stuck in my mind over the years particularly because so many upper-division undergraduate women and graduate student women passed the rumors about him."NotAvailable,NotAvailable,NotAvailable,"The conductor of the new music ensemble verbally abused me for months on end, culminating in an email that called me ""pushy and un-self-aware"""male,social&humanities,Other R1,"At the end of term, I received an anonymous note I will never forget.

The evening of the night the man was staying there, after dinner - which we had eaten together and talked about science, careers, etc etc - he asked me, ""would you like some company in bed tonight?""

Technically, this relationship was in violation of the university's sexual conduct policies, as the adjunct faculty member taught in the graduate students' department. The relationship turned unhealthy when the male partner began to play each of the female partners against each other. Ultimately, my friend (who also lives with bipolar disorder) despaired and committed an act of self-harm. Though she recovered and remained active in the program, my friend's action brought the previously secret relationship to the attention of other graduate students in the department. However, my friend's female and male former partners both actively sought to maintain the relationship's secrecy by harassing and threatening other graduate students who inquired about the relationship and/or offered my friend support. The former partners successfully recruited some graduate students to their ""side,"" which created a stilted he-said/she-said/she-said dynamic. My friend, out of a combination of fear of drawing further departmental attention to herself and of potential reprisals from her former partners, insisted that none of this behavior be reported officially. At the time, I agreed out of respect for her wishes; I have come to regret this decision. In the end, the events were an open secret, as the entire graduate student body in the department became embroiled in the affair.

At the time, I was excited to be 'chosen' by a faculty member and to receive recognition for my ideas. He invited me to sit in on one of his undergraduate lectures and meet with him afterward in his office to discuss our committee obligations. In our conversation, he asked me about my research and I shared information about my project (and the fact that my project was informed by a personal experience of reproductive loss) . He told me that he *knew* he sensed something *different* about me, but presumed that I had been sexually molested. He then put his hands on my upper thigh and started caressing me. I almost overlooked the fact that he was touching me because I was so horrified and self-conscious thinking that something about how I conducted myself at the first committee meeting gave him the false impression that I had been sexually molested. In retrospect, I now that he was fishing for information and testing the waters with me to assess my vulnerabilities. And I know now that I was targeted by him, which is why he specifically asked to work with me in a team. But at the time, I completely internalized blame for what was happening and thought that I must have done or said something to give him this impression. Regrettably, the approach that I took to dealing with his unwanted attention was to continue working with him in a team and 'prove' (to him? to myself?) that I was capable, confident, in control, and NOT ""damaged"". All that resulted in was more situations where we were alone together. The whole experience was gross and inappropriate.

Didn't even say hello..."male,social&humanities,Other Type of School,"inappropriate touching, sexual commentary, inquiries about personal sexual preferences"male,social&humanities,Other R1,"Bear with me. I'm shocked at how long ago this was and shocked at how immediate the pain can still feel. I'm not sure when it began, but if it had begun obviously, then it might have been avoidable (or so I am telling myself). This begins in the late 1980s and continues through the 1990s. The perpetrator was a history professor at my undergraduate and graduate institution. I took two classes from him in successive semesters in a subject that I had been dying to study from a professional since I was nine years old. At the end of the last semester, upon finding out I was about to graduate, he asked me to lunch in the faculty restaurant because, he told me, he always took his graduating students to lunch. I thought nothing of this, including the fact that I was the only student at lunch since this was December graduation, and was flattered. About a year or two later, after a major depressive breakdown and recovery, I had decided that I wanted to go to graduate school and become a historian specializing in that field. I went to talk with him about pursuing a degree. He recommended a number of good schools, but said that the best was right there at the University of Houston, studying with him. I look back on it now and laugh at how na账ve I was. I actually believed him that it was a good idea to study colonial Native American history at University of Houston with a military historian who knew nothing about Native Americans. (He has, of course, in the past decade co-written a book about Native Americans in the American Revolution. That was my dissertation proposal. Not that I had a monopoly on topic, but still.)Now, understand that no one had told me that the school should offer you funding or anything like that. I knew nothing about graduate school. He did not enlighten me. So, when he said, ""stay here,"" I thought nothing of it and was a bit relieved because that meant I could continue to live at home and cut down on expenses since I was going to be paying for this out of my own savings and perhaps loans. Had I better advice, I might have applied to a better program with someone who had better grounding in the specific area that I wanted to study. Likewise, the semester before I defended my master's thesis, the semester in which most master's student would be applying to a doctoral program if they were in my position, other students asked me where I would apply. I didn't know that I should, which was when I learned that three degrees from the same school, especially a place like UH, is not the best career plan. I asked a couple of other faculty about it, and they told me the same. So, I went to him for advice. He grew furious and demanded to know who would dare tell me this. Meanwhile, he was doing all he could to help a male graduate student apply to Cornell and Columbia. That same student he helped get funding to travel to archives for his master's thesis but told me that I did not need to go to archives for research. Another professor said that he would never pass a master's thesis if the student had not gone to an archive and, although that professor would have been a perfect person to sit on my committee, my harasser would not allow him to sit on it for that reason. Up to this point, I've only been describing the unethically bad advice that this person gave me. The sexual harassment part is almost laughably mundane and clich诈. It began with meetings at lunch time. Could I meet at noon? Oh, hey, it's lunch time! Am I hungry? Let's go get something to eat at the faculty cafeteria. He'll pay. Oh, it's crowded. How about off-campus? That sort of thing. Then, he wanted to meet after class, which ended at 9 pm. He'd close the blinds, although we were on the sixth floor. He'd shut the door. He'd want to meet in his ""secret office"" without windows. His shoulder had a cramp, could I rub it. How about his back? Here, sit on his lap. Really! Sit on his lap. Suggestions about my clothing, about the way that I buttoned the top button on my shirt, or that my skirts were so long, or so short, or that I didn't wear heels, or did. Complaints about his wife and the way she didn't understand him. Complaints about how much he did for everyone and was never appreciated -- ""all I get is a dick up my ass,"" was the way he put it. I'm not kidding. He even gave me a box of chocolate kisses on Valentine's Day and said that he hoped it was full of orgasms.These things came gradually, in a crescendo, moving me from student, to friend, to confidante, to -- I don't know -- schoolyard crush in our interactions.At the same time, he issued steady reminders that, if I did not accept the role, there were consequences. Those comments about being unappreciated contained stories that seemed to me veiled threats. For instance, he said that one student had not thanked him sufficiently in the acknowledgements of his thesis and therefore he would not help that student in job searches or other recommendations in the future. In another instance, he had learned that another, female student (who was quite pregnant at the time) has passed her comprehensive exams. He called her into his office and said something like ""let me give you a hug in congratulations."" According to him, she backed of. He said that one move told him that he disgusted her and that he was never going to help her with her career, write her a letter of recommendation, or get her dissertation published. So, this told me that I was supposed to publically praise him and allow him to touch me or he would not do the things an advisor was supposed to do in helping a student. Other little micro threats like this cropped up constantly in his disparaging of other students and faculty. Meanwhile, as my advisor, he made sure that I took classes only from him unless absolutely necessary, then only from junior faculty who would not contradict him. He had me do independent studies with him, working on a project as his research assistant, with the promise that the project would result in a publication. Yet, somehow, at the end of the semester, each time, the publication would not materialize because he would have to ""put the project on the back burner,"" and I would not have advanced much in my own research or education. I later learned that this was his modus operandi for his targets, simply to keep them from taking classes from other professors while also earning the requisite number of credits.Two incidents happened when I knew that I could not deny what was going on. The first came one summer, during the last of those independent study classes. There was a weird incident involving a long-time, disturbed graduate student who had submitted an epic poem instead of a dissertation and certain aspects of this poem could easily be interpreted as death threats on the lives of several faculty members, including the harasser. The harasser took to meeting students at a restaurant just off campus frequented by police. That is, until the time came for my meeting. Then, he decided that he had been there too long and was too regular in his movements. He had to throw the would-be assassin off. He wanted to meet at this restaurant elsewhere. As I got out of my car in the parking lot and headed toward the door of the new restaurant, the harasser got out of his and said, ""hey, how about over here?"" He pointed to an unmarked door under a stairway on the side of a the building. Meanwhile, two people got out of separate cars in the parking lot, looked about, joined one another, and went in that door, as if perhaps they shouldn't be. ""There's supposed to be a bar over here that the graduate students go to,"" he said. I reminded him that I didn't drink and that I'd rather go to the restaurant, but he went over to the door and walked in. Like a sheep I followed him. The only place to sit was on sofas. He pestered me to order alcohol, although he ordered a non-alcoholic beer. I only ordered a Diet Coke. He kept moving away from the subject of the research project and skirting towards sexual topics. I was wearing walking shorts (down to my knees, it was Houston in the summer, after all), a t-shirt, and a long sleeve shirt as a jacket. He suggested that I loosen up and show off a bit more, then he reached over and moved my outer shirt over and peered down at my chest. I covered myself up and said that I was fine just the way I was. His whole demeanor changed. He was clearly insulted. More than that, after that incident, his evaluation of my work, my intelligence, my abilities altered drastically. No longer was I a promising student making excellent progress. I was now lazy and without an analytical mind. He demanded that I take my comprehensive exams three semesters earlier in my program than any other student and before I had finished my coursework, otherwise, he said, I'd be lagging behind and he could do nothing for me. The second incident took place when I decided on a dissertation topic. I brought it to him, but it quickly became apparent that he did not want to talk about the topic. He wanted me to grovel to him. He told me that, if I were to continue to be his student I would have to do everything he said, not just taking the classes he said and following the instructions that he issued, but that I could not date, I could not have friends that he did not approve of, I could not talk to people who me did not approve of, and so on and so forth in a litany of control that astounded me. I knew that I had to get out of there no matter what. So, I told him that I would be finding a new advisor. I had no idea what I was going to do, but I walked out the door, down the hall, into another professor's office, and begged him to take me on, which he did, to his own peril. Shortly thereafter, I lost funding, and the harasser was and had been for many years the head of the committee who allocated the very limited t.a. positions. I later found out many things had been going on behind the scenes. He had ensured that one of the graduate students whom I was dating lost his funding. He golfed with another graduate student and engaged in all sorts of locker room talk about me on the links. He would tell other students or faculty that I was a flake and not very bright. He told me that he wrote a critical evaluation of me, but when I saw that evaluation it was not critical. He threatened other faculty away from me when he saw me speaking with them. He threatened my second advisor when my second advisor tried to advocate for me. When the entire committee decided to reinstate my funding, he went into an apoplectic fit until they relented and did not. The glowing acknowledgement that he had intimidated me into writing he then used as evidence that he could not have harassed me. He told people that I ""showed up"" at lunch time to trick him into taking me to lunch, when he had made the appointments, and otherwise painted me as someone with a poor sense of boundaries. So, all while he was telling me that I was brilliant, he was telling everyone else that I was crazy and stupid. When I found that out, that's exactly what I felt. "male,social&humanities,Other R1,"I was a second year in graduate school and my PI, who is a serial narcissistic abuser sought to control my entire life sending countless texts and emails to monitor my whereabouts, not allowing me to go on vacation because ""I hadn't earned it"" etc. The sexual harassment came in the place of pressure for me to break up with a boyfriend I had at the time as well as other unwanted comments about how I dressed in lab. He would discourage me from eating lunch with my boyfriend and harass me when he noticed we were hanging out together. In a private meeting he said to me ""I know you're always coming in late because of you and your boyfriends extracurricular activities,"" referring to having sex before coming to work. It's a long and awful story really but long story short, he harassed me until I broke up with my boyfriend and moved closer to lab. He threatened to fire me every day unless I did whatever it was he was wanting me to do- cancel my vacation time, sleep in lab. ""If it were me, I would have slept her until the results came out. How can I make you care that much?"" When I stared to fight back and stand up for myself, he lied to my committee about me misrepresenting my work in order to have me dismissed from the program. I fought this using recordings of conversations and other evidence of the emotional abuse and after threatening to sue, the assistant dean of the graduate school intervened and made a pathway for me to stay in the program but I was already at my wit's end and decided to leave anyway which likely saved my life. I had worked so hard to get my PhD from this #1 program and he had me wrapped so tightly around his finger that I nearly attempted suicide. After I left, three other women in my lab left without the PhD they came there for and I do not doubt it was because of this PIs inappropriate behavior. I still suffer from PTSD and associated issues from the 2 years I spent being abused by this man. The worst part is that even though he lost 5 students in five years they still awarded him tenure (I was one f his first students). In this particular program abuse is not only the norm but is encouraged because his fellow professors (all white men) only encouraged his behavior and when I tried to reach out for help, they discouraged me from seeking help even from a mediator who would help our meetings. As bad as my experience was, I witnessed far worse things happening to my fellow students in other labs.

As a first year doctoral student, I was propositioned at a professional conference by a prominent, senior scholar in my field-he acted as if he was interested in my research interests and then tried to get me to go with him to his hotel room to spend the night. I demurred and really had to keep giving excuses until he finally took no for an answer. Given his status, I was certain that there would be professional repercussions in the future. I still see him at conferences and professional meetings: twice a year minimum over the last 25 years or so, which is of course very uncomfortable. The second instance, in my first years as a new faculty member I was also subject to harassing comments by a senior colleague in my department. It was finally so bad and was happening in front of my students, I spoke to my dean. He encouraged me not to speak to HR but to have a sit-down in his office, with the perp and an ally of the perp. My colleague was shocked that I had been offended and promised reform. He was much more careful in how he spoke to me in public; interestingly, my dean had no trouble with (making sure that?) the perp was on the faculty evaluation committee when I went up for tenure. The perp made sure to make ""off handed comments"" around me about the power he wielded on the committee so that I was terrified about my prospects for tenure. I was worried that had I spoken up officially or gone to HR at that point, there would be gossip that I was not qualified for tenure and that this was my way of gaming the system (not true) or that I would be detested for going against everyone's favorite good old boy and that that would also lead colleagues to think I was not ""collegial."" Either way, it seemed to me that I would lose by speaking up. So I didn't do anything but ask the provost that I hoped my application would be fully read and vetted by more than just one or two people on the committee. She assured me my application would be read thoroughly and I did receive tenure.

I did not tell any of the people involved in that circle because I was embarrassed that it had happened to me (I had a much less informed idea about consent back then, and certainly didn't consider it to be something that one would report.

Essentially, he was asking 19 year-old-girls if they wanted to go to Croatia with him, to be his research assistant. This happened multiple times, over multiple semesters. I asked my department chair for advice, because very excited students would rush in to talk to me about it, he told me to walk those girls into his office.

When I spoke to him, he looked and the ground and said, ""Thanks"" -- then he cut me off professionally, never to speak to me again. He broke up with this particular student shortly after my confrontation and used my name *while he was still inside of her* in a post-coital ""this isn't working out"" move. He would go on to sleep with several other students while I was in school (and after). This behavior established a value system that confused the metrics for ""good work,"" created competition between women that had nothing to do with the program or our education, and normalized predatory behavior. Of course he has been promoted several times and never held accountable even though his antics are widely known. 2011: My advisor commented on my breasts in a meeting about my thesis. This was part of a comment he was making about why he didn't understand that the professor who slept with students was seeing/interested in a friend/colleague of mine who, according to my advisor was less attractive than me ""because [my] breasts [we]re so much larger than hers"". This was completely unprompted, of course. 2011-2013 I started dating a man who was a year ahead of me in my grad program who serially harassed my friends by constantly crossing boundaries, not accepting no for an answer, and groping them (sometimes in front of me, sometimes not) while we were together. Of course this means that he harassed me, too. We were together for about six months when he moved to the east coast to attend a PhD program from which he was expelled for groping a woman's genitals at an off campus party. Because they were both in the same PhD program, she was able to levy charges. The University suspended him, and after the term was up they took away his funding, but did not require him to leave the program. He quit when the money ran out. During this time of crisis, he turned to me to perform the emotional labor of supporting him without revealing all of the details of what had gone down. After a couple of years, he moved back to where I lived and began adjuncting at the institution where we met. Not only did the faculty support him during his suspension (he reached out to the professor who slept with students to ask for advice), but they hired him back to work in their department knowing fell well of his transgressions, the charges filed, and his 'fall from grace' in the PhD program he moved across the country to attend."male,social&humanities,Elite Institution/Ivy League,"-older male colleague making a point to single me out as a young woman on faculty recruiting tour, not comfortable with me _岩driving on my own in the late afternoon or early evening._ _延older male colleague mimicking the sound of my high heels in a _岩humorous_ way."male,social&humanities,Other R1,"When I was a newly hired assistant professor, my department chair would routinely come into my office, tell me how frustrated he was in his marriage, describe incidents in which women had supposedly hit on him, and inquire into the health of my current relationship and sex life.

I was very surprised to be informed- in 1995, on a January Monday at 1:15 p.m.- that I was accused of two years of _岩ongoing and increasingly worsening sexual harassment_ and that there was a request I be expelled from the school, this from five fellow female students at a small Canadian college. I was to attend a meeting the following morning at 9:15 in the _岩Executive Meeting Room,_ according to the short handwritten note on the envelope I was provided, with eight pages enclosed, including four pages of sexual harassment allegations, signed by the women, and four pages of either college rules regarding sexual harassment and/or college procedure on dealing with such issues. The next morning, as I was seated alone in the hallway terminus, five fellow female students were led by me, by a sympathetic college staffer, who looked like a helpful aunt with a collection of flower girls before a wedding, as four of the women were dressed in white, toes to shoulders. The college staffer led them to an adjoining room to the large Board of Governors Chambers. I was led into chambers about five minutes later, by a college vice-president, who pointed a chair to me, his back to me as he walked, without pausing or breaking stride, in a gesture I thought at the time like a duck hunter would point orders to a hound. Again, the allegations comprised four typewritten pages signed by these women, all student journalists, one student editor, one advertising manager, and one friend- which was a shock to my then girlfriend. When I showed her the allegations her face went so white her freckles stood out. We locked eyes, trapped in the surreal nature of it all, in one concentrated moment. I had read the first page only by the time the hearing began. I thought the issue was so bizarre I would attend the meeting the following morning to find out what was going on. The reason why my girlfriend was shocked upon reading the allegations is that she met this friend, ***, the previous November, just two months prior. On that occasion *** came to the newspaper classroom office where I was working late, alone, about 7:00 p.m., my girlfriend seated beside me, waiting for me to finish typing out some project. We were journalism students, after all. *** asked if I was familiar with the trades wing of the college. I was. She said she had to cover a trades show and didn_验t want to walk there by herself, and would I mind walking with her. I said sure. Students have the option of asking security to escort, but a friend does in a pinch. When I got to the newspaper office door, I turned to my girlfriend and suggested we all may as well go down. It was a bit of a hike, the long corridor in trades did look dimmer than during the day. We quickly discovered the proper door, and it was a full trade show inside, Snap-On Tools with a truck and tool display, Bear Instruments, others, a agriculture combine with a pexiglass side so viewers could see its workings, plus coffee and donuts. Once inside *** went her way and we went ours, to take a look. Just over one week prior to this meeting in the Board of Governors Chambers, *** came into the newspaper office, and exactly as before, my girlfriend was waiting for me to finish typing out a project and in exactly the same seats. This time *** was livid. The student editors, who chose which stories were printed, had met their 24-story quota for marks, as well as their lovers and close friends, but none of the other writers had, like herself. Without those published stories her final mark suffered. She invited me to a meeting where the writers were to confront the editors. I attended that meeting- by accident, as I had my first class in the room, and tired, at the end of the class with an hour free, I laid my head down on my desk to sleep when the room began filling up with writers and editors. *** sat on the floor. _岩I made it,_ I called to her. _岩I was looking for you,_ she said.The room was unusual in that the desks were against three walls, creating a speaking well in the middle of the classroom, an unusual seating arrangement.I spoke on behalf of the writers, earning the obvious wrath of one of the two senior editors, ***, who demanded to know why I was at the meeting, a rather odd question. That was just over a week prior to this meeting in the Board of Governors Chambers where *** sat beside ***, both of them dressed in white from shoulders to toes, demanding- this is not an understatement- my expulsion from the college, both citing, with three other students, a long history of sexual harassment.To say I was shocked is an understatement. Nothing came to mind. I could not fathom these women could tell an untruth. It was not a formulated thought of mine that they had lied. All I felt was this whole experience was surreal. The other three women were ***- I thought that was her first name for the longest time, like Mary Ann or Peggy Sue- but actually *** is a last name. *** and *** were the other two. I_验m sure after nearly a quarter century their last names have been all changed with marriage. *** was the only one of the five women who was not dressed in white. _岩Nothing of a sexual nature has happened to me,_ she said. She told the committee she was there to support her friends and that she was a witness to many of the sexual harassment episodes. Interestingly, well after the hearing was done, when I showed the allegations to a retired city police inspector- he had taken up private investigating- the first thing he did after reading was tap the page with the back of his hand- where ***_验s name was- and said, _岩She_验s the ringleader._ Even then, right at the time he said it, I didn_验t understand. It took a moment to fathom what he, with his long years of police investigative experience, could see in a moment. The allegations read out ranged from *** wrote I had rubbed my head on her legs- this was, apparently, immediately after that meeting of writers vs. editors. *** wrote I had asked her about her and her boyfriend, which, she said, were questions that were not of my business and made her feel very uncomfortable- this was part of a brief conversation about November or December, we talked sporadically as we typed. *** wrote I had leered at her leg _岩accidentally_ exposed from the knee down- I am not kidding here- and had also asked her out once repeatedly and she had to leave the room to end the requests- I had actually asked her what was happening in the Barn- the student bar on campus where liquor was served and musicians played- and did ask her if she wanted to go- and she, in turn, asked her teacher boyfriend, who answered from the hallway, just outside the door, until then hidden from view, and she said they would meet me there. I ended up working late and didn_验t go. *** said I had leaned on her leg while talking to her and this put her in so much fear she was afraid to leave the student newspaper office until I was well gone for some minutes. I was on my heels for the entirety of the hearing. It was too much to absorb. I was entirely unprepared. It was a bit like a police officer asking if you_验d come down to the station to answer questions to get something cleared up, and instead, being escorted into a courtroom where the judge is waiting, the jury is waiting, the Crown Prosecutor is waiting, the allegations are presented, and after a 15-minute break you are told to defend yourself. Nothing came to mind. I rambled helplessly. That I had not been their fellow student for a year and a half as alleged never came to mind. I had been their classmate for one semester and three weeks, as I had graduated with my own class the year before , in April, and came back as a third-year student. That never came to mind. That I had worked late in the newspaper office with my own classmates, most of them female, ***, my editor, at least 20 times, late and alone, no problems, ***, a teacher of 14 years experience, about five times, late and alone no problems, ***, a former beauty queen, I_验m sure 30 times or more, late and alone in the newspaper office, no problems, ***, once _验til 5:00 a.m., late and alone, no problems, the list goes on, ***, ***, others, if not late and alone, we worked for hours each day week in week out in our two-year college until graduation. That never came to mind. One member of the sexual harassment committee, the registrar, asked if me if anyone had ever felt uncomfortable around me before. The committee_验s student member asked me if I knew it was wrong, why did I do it. I wondered aloud why the issue was happening so quickly, I just learned about the issue the previous afternoon. _岩I AM THE CHAIRMAN!_ the vice-president bellowed, and I shut up about that, I thought I_验d be kicked out of the room.The women were not challenged by committee members on any item. Later I understood why. To challenge a victim on the truth of allegations is to revictimize them. That_验s why I was challenged. But I was not prepared at all. I hadn_验t yet even absorbed the impact of what was occurring. At one point *** said I had shown the allegations around the newspaper office- I had- and she wanted me _岩brought to issue_ on that as by doing so I had disrupted their place of work and their safety. _岩We have to work there to do the work we have to do. He has disrupted it,_ she said.At home, a day or days after the sexual harassment hearing, I read the allegations for the first time. I discovered, then, for the first time, they were in the form of a petition. I called out to my girlfriend, _岩Hey! This was a petition about me!_All these many years later it is hard to fathom the sexual harassment committee took ***_验s complaint seriously, that I should be in trouble for showing a petition to students who worked in that newspaper office. I had shown about five or six female students while I sat in one spot. I really wanted to know what they thought of them. I was at a complete loss. So were they, it seemed. In the end I was found guilty, expelled from the college, and would only be allowed back with the permission of the college president, the two-vice-presidents, and the dean of student services.There was no appeal permitted. I did write the college and ask about their appeal provisions, later, on the advice of a lawyer, who grinned broadly when the answer came back that there was no appeal. With that meant we could proceed directly to Court of Queen_验s Bench. To make a long story short, I won in court. I returned to college just shy of one year later, in January 1996. A female student journalist in the new second-year class asked me for an interview about what I_验d gone through. She suggested we go into anther room for the interview. We walked into the very room where, almost exactly one year before, that writers vs. editors meeting had taken place. She likely would have known nothing about it. She would have been a first-year student then. The room looked exactly the same. The desks were in the exactly the same place, against three walls of the classroom, creating a speaking well in the middle of the room. It felt surreal. As she asked questions I ignored her, walking from desk to desk, putting my hands on the desks, incredulous. It was as if I walked into a time tunnel, suddenly transported back one year before the sexual harassment hearing, before the court process. It was as if I had been transported back in time to the last place where things made sense. I didn_验t sue for money. I just wanted the decision of the college overturned so I could continue my education. I returned to the college and lasted one semester. Those looks of disdain I had from the communications staffer and that receptionist were rife in the college They were everywhere. I was untrusted and the talk of the college.

"male,social&humanities,Other Research Agency,"Two incidents. 1. 1980s: I was a grad student and an extremely famous visiting scholar whose class I was taking body-blocked his office door and pressured me to come back to his lodgings one night. Something similar happened to the other woman grad student in the class. There were reporting procedures in place for faculty who harassed undergrads, but not grad students, at the time, and it was not entirely uncommon for faculty and grad students to become involved. When I told my mentors in the dept. -- all women -- they 'tsked' and said it was a shame but just to do my best work in the class and hope for a good grade. In the end, he gave everyone in the class the same grade without, evidently, having read the papers. (I should say, however, that harassment was so common for women at the time, I finally just shrugged the incident off. Recently, however, when I attempted to tell fellow academics about it, some -- including women -- reacted with denial, saying they could not believe that the scholar would do that, both because it contradicted his politics and because he later became involved with a man.) 2. Late 1990s: I had my first job, a visiting appointment. The new department chair, appointed from another university, took an evidently unusual liking to me, appointed me to committees and positions inappropriate for a visitor, and told me that if I did well in these he would try to arrange a tenure-track job. I had come from a working-class background where I was used to this kind of thing at jobs and didn't realize that it was not proper academic procedure. He made remarks strongly implying to fellow faculty that we were having an affair. I tried to imply back that this was no so, but did not feel free to say anything that would upset him. They treated me very poorly. An added complication was that a few key woman faculty members appeared to be highly jealous, as he was considered very dashing, as well as understandably resentful of this special treatment -- though I had not asked for it and didn't know what to do about it. I went to a compliance officer, and was told that I could file a report, but that it would very likely be damaging to my career; this seemed true, so I didn't. In the end, he did try to arrange a tenure-track appointment; the rest of the department quietly rebelled; he was made to step down as chair for other reasons; my visiting appointment was ended a year early due to 'budgetary considerations'; and I was forced to leave for another -- thankfully, much better and saner -- visiting job elsewhere. (Here I should make a caveat as well. I do not believe that he realized what he was doing was harassment. He seemed genuinely to feel that I was a person of special ability -- or to project that upon me -- and that we were beginning a meaningful working, and romantic, relationship. His last relationship had been with one of this grad students, who then became his colleague, elsewhere. At the new institution, he said, he felt lonely and misunderstood. Because I did not feel myself in a position to tell him what I really felt, he took my politeness as confirmation. I say this not to defend him in any possible way but to slightly nuance such situations, in which the powerful do not view their imposition as one of force or violence, but are rather unable to see that it is inappropriate to use underlings to fulfill their physical and/or emotional needs. I also believe that this explains why so much of this behavior is generationally-bound -- that younger faculty may have more cultural awareness. I would also like to say, however, that I feel complicit in having accepted special treatment on this basis, though. The flip side to harassment no one's talking about is unfairness to those passed over for opportunities in favor of the direct target. Not to victim-blame; however -- as Laura Kipnis argues in a recent New York Review of Books piece rather sharper than some of her previous works -- women are not children. As long as some stand to benefit from playing into traditional gender roles, or passively fail to resist them, objectification -- dehumanization of women into both 'attractive' and 'unattractive' or 'repulsive' objects, the first both rewarded and imperiled; the second imperiled in different ways -- women will simply be reinforcing the system.)"male,social&humanities,Other R1,Hit on by Prof.male,social&humanities,Other R1,"In a lift, after a meeting with a senior member of academic staff, a colleague in a graduate studies student association with whom I had been participating at the meeting, approached me in utter fury, invaded my personal space with his head inches from mine, and in a clearly threatening manner, warned me not to undermine him in future in meetings (I had no idea what he was talking about and was speechless in shock). My immediate response was to back away, raise my hand between us, and check where the panic button was in the lift.

Even as an outside committee member, he refused to accept my dissertation for more than two years. It was horrifically stressful and I had every reason to believe that he was bad-mouthing me everywhere (turning the fact that I could not get my dissertation done into the message about my lack of abilities...when he was the one refusing to read it).

I dismissed it as odd, but looking back, that was a GIGANTIC red flag - why would you even think to say that?A casual friendship progressed to constantly asking me out through many ""no""s. He would corner me in an empty hallway and tell me how beautiful I was, and that I'd regret not going on a date with him, details of his current (evidently prolific) sex life and how he'd pull younger women (I was 26 and he was 40). My dismissal of his interest just made him come on stronger. The most egregious incident was after I went to lunch with him; he tried to kiss me in the parking lot of the school, in the close quarters of his car. I pushed him away; he's 6'7"" and muscular, so I consider myself lucky that he didn't push further than that. He claimed another employee had a crush on him and was jealous of me. I have no idea if this was true; I do know he was using the story to try to emphasize how ""lucky"" I was that he was paying me attention, i.e. that SOME women would fall over backwards for him, but he was choosing ME. He emphasized that last part rather often; that despite all the other women he was seeing and bedding, he'd drop them for me in an instant.I had heard from other women that he was known for this sort of thing, though I don't know to what extent.

A member of the staff (quasi-faculty, non-tenured) whose role was conceptualized as outreach (Director of a national non-profit located within an academic program, which virtually all organizations focused on the discipline belong to) became notably obsessed with a former grad assistant and current grad assistant of his supervisor. The behavior was not overtly threatening, and he consulted me about his ""crush"" on one of the two. He was also dating a friend of mine at the time. His supervisor asked me about it eventually, as did his girlfriend, because he told them/me about efforts to engage both parties, including eventually asking the graduate assistant to his boss out and being rejected, but continuing to make reasons to talk to, address, work with, and so on the assistant. There was gossip about him ""leering"" at the assistant, and he and his girlfriend had a fight about the former assistant, when he tricked her into going to a concert at which he knew both the current and former assistants would be there, at which he was highly focused on the two assistants and not on his girlfriend. His girlfriend told me she felt he was ""obsessed"" with both, and told me after the concert incident that she felt he might be stalking them. I was later told that the current assistant had told her boss that she was uncomfortable, and asked that provisions be made for her to avoid him. Unfortunately, he was in the office well beyond standard business hours, and their offices were near each other, so this required her to shift her focus somewhat from in-office work to field work, and to work in the office only when others could be present.

No matter how many times I verbally explained I didn't like it, my supervisor kept touching me. It was part of a larger pattern of harassment from two people, my Academic Chair and Dean, which included teaching assignments that exceeded allowance limits in the collective agreements for which I had to keep going through the grievance process to be right-sized. One day I finally stopped my supervisor from hugging me by putting up my hand and holding her back. She immediately complained to the Dean and HR. A disciplinary letter accusing me of insubordination was put in my permanent employee file (for refusing a hug!) and I was docked a day of pay. I had to file a grievance to get the loss of pay reversed and the union helped me fight it all the way to arbitration. But, paperwork is now in my permanent file at this institution accusing me of insubordination, but with no context explaining the situation. Every step of the way, the senior leadership defended this behaviour insisting she had a right to touch me in whatever way she wanted at any time. For the first time, I finally understood why HR had done such a poor job supporting faculty when we were being sexually harassed by students. As the Director of HR said right to my face, they did not think we had rights over our own bodies when at work.

It all blew up when it came out that he was dating two people who he directly supervised at the same time. Plus the money was running out. This was a little more than a year ago.

We sat down on the couch and he served me a bizarre strong liqueur that I didn't drink. Suddenly, in the middle of our conversation, he threw himself on top of me, kissing me even as I squirmed away. He groped me, tried to push himself into my underwear under my skirts, and kept trying to French-kiss me as he attempted to undress me. Somehow I managed to push him off me. He then cried and said he was lonely and begged me to stay to eat something. I was terrified he'd bad-name me to my other professors in the department so I stayed. The ""meal"" was almost worse than the groping: for two hours, he didn't ask me anything about my research or give me any real advice but instead made me listen to his problems with his relationships, divorce, etc. After that day, he made no effort to find out how my research on my senior thesis was progressing--or even if I had found someone else to supervise my project."male,social&humanities,NotAvailable,"Upon meeting me for the first time, in a one-on-one conversation, the senior woman said, ""I gotta say, you are just beautiful.""

When I texted him back less, didn't pick up his phone calls, or tried to pull away, there was always some sort of consequence: a reminder that thesis prizes were coming up; later on, my grad school recommendations were mysteriously ""late"" when I stopped texting. I performed warmness until he submitted the recs_延he was known in the field.

I had to insist all the time I didn't have a crush on him. UGH! How could one improve if one couldn't work closely with the professor. Fortunately the work for that course was done outside the studio so I could limit my contact, if not stem the loss of the artistic skills a more noble man might have helped me develop.#2: Spring semester: Second guy haunted the studio at night and on weekends when students were required to work there.

I worried that if I didn't talk to him at all hours or listen to his bizarre ranting, especially about female colleagues, that he would blackball me with other professors or in my graduate school applications (he insisted throughout the autumn that he should be writing to support my grad school applications and though I never gave him a form, I was still afraid he'd do something to jeopardize my career). In the second semester, he cut my hours and told me that I would instead help him with his research because there weren't enough students needing tutorial work--a situation that meant I would have more personal contact with him, the last thing I wanted.

I had another male student colleague tell me that my best shot at academic success would be to wear a low-cut blouse to all meetings with my advisor.I was in a graduate seminar where the female students got lower grades than the male students.I was in a graduate seminar where every time a male student made an observation, the professor would refer to it later by saying, ""as Joe said a moment ago..."" but if a woman made a remark the professor wanted to bring up later, he would say, ""somebody pointed out...""

One stands out as the worst, but the others were just as worthy of being written here. I will stick with this one: A tenured professor repeatedly came to my office taking up increasingly large amounts of my time talking about nothing, trying to get me to talk about my ""feelings"" and my childhood, and repeatedly talking about his as a way of asking me about mine. After trying to get the person to back off in nice-ish ways, such as by saying that I had a lot of work to do (this did not stop the person), I had to begin asking this professor more bluntly to please back off a bit, such as by talking about professional and personal boundaries and how I needed him to respect these. The professor did not stop. He flooded me with emails, most of which were bizarre and prying emails. If I did not answer them soon after they were sent (and they were sent not just during the work week but at nights and on weekends as well), then he would then come to my office and insist that we talk / have a long discussion about this --i.e., about why I did not answer his emails, about what my feelings were about his emails, and about how he was hurt that I had not answered. When I tried to avoid these meetings by insisting that he respect work/professional boundaries he also started insisting that he had no idea what ""my"" boundaries were, that the only way he could know this was to test them, and so I *had* to answer his questions about my feelings. he continued to send me inappropriate emails and to visit to my office and demand long periods of my time. Some of these emails said things like: he wanted to start a fan club for me, he wanted to work together with me on academic articles, he wanted to do a book reading club with me (so that I would have to spend endless amounts of time talking with him about some book), and did I like/would I accept hugs..... Since nothing was working and he kept insisting he could not know what *my* boundaries were, I had to make them very clear: I outlined in an email that I would not answer his emails on the weekends or at night, that I would not answer any emails that were not strictly work related, and that --since there was really absolutely nothing we needed to email about relating to work-- I did not want to receive more than one email from him a week. I also said that I probably would not be able to answer this email right away, and that he needed to accept that it may take me a day or so to get back to him. He flipped out and tried to tell me that the whole reason I had gotten the job was because HE pushed for me to be hired, and the whole reason he had done this was because he thought that he and I were going to be good friends. He had thought I was one of those people he could really connect with, and he was so hurt. And he was angry that he had been mistaken about this....etc. He sort of threw a tantrum. For the first week after this he did send me a single email. The second week I received no contact from him at all, and I thought finally I had managed the situation. But the third week he stopped me in the hallway to say that I had not answered his last email. Confused, I told him that I had. It turned out that he had sent me an email the second week, but he sent it to the wrong address (to a student's address). Because I had not received it, he reforwarded it to me, then also sent me another email. Both of these emails had nothing to do with work, but were all about his feelings around this new situation. He also printed out an additional letter and shoved it under my door. AND he put a card in my mail box with Hershey's ""kisses"" and ""hugs"" taped to it. This was all within the span of 2 or 3 days. And then, when I did not respond to any of these, he called me on the phone in my office (from his office) to find out why I was not responding. I had to go to the department chair for advice. And things just got worse from there."male,social&humanities,Regional Teaching College,"Professor (my advisor) walked up behind me in lab, grabbed my braid, and said, ""Nice handle."" He laughed to himself and my male friends were appalled. We were all too shocked to do or say anything at the moment. Same professor would tell me I was beautiful frequently. Same professor would slowly encroach on my personal space during the course of a conversation, slowly inching his way closer. I only noticed this when I had retreated so far that I bumped into furniture. My male friends in the program would go with me to the professor's office to ask hw questions since I didn't want to be alone with him - less awkward comments about my looks when others were around. "male,social&humanities,Other R1,"A male professor found me on linked in and sent me messages with sexual connotations. He told me I was hot, suggested meeting for a hookup once class was over... after I refused, he went away for a while but then started messaging me again after a few months. I blocked him & did not contact him for a letter of rec, even though I was applying for a PhD in his field of study."male,natural,Elite Institution/Ivy League,I recall a fellow graduate student saying during a meeting of graduate students of colour that she was the victim of bullying by the then male Chair of the English Department at the University of Colorado at Boulder. She was pursuing a graduate degree within that department. My recollection was that she thought this to be a pattern of behaviour suffered by others as well. This story was told to us somewhere in the period 1990 - 1994.male,social&humanities,Other R1,"In 1999, I was sexually assaulted at knife point by a grad school class mate/ jilted boy friend (who broke into my apartment and planted grey IKEA knives all over my living space). He left my home and went directly to the chair of my department, who was a confidant of his. The chair of my department declared that my rapist was ""just blowing off steam"" (his pent up anger being the result of my having left him). I did not file a complaint. I was dealing with a critically ill father and was shy and embarrassed, having been well warned about this man's violent tendencies by several female faculty (""I told you sos"" were thick in the air). Not one person did a thing, including me. My having never I pressed charges is, hands down, the biggest regret of my life. I have, throughout my life, worried that this decision has resulted in this man assaulting other women. I am sure he has and I feel responsible. "male,NotAvailable,Elite Institution/Ivy League,"I was a graduate student attending the national conference in my discipline. During my presentation Q&A, a male senior faculty member (who I didn't know at all) berated me publicly for my research, outlining in detail each part of my presentation he took issue with. When I called on other people during my Q&A session, he scoffed loudly and would wave his hand dismissively each time I answered, to the point where the chair of my panel intervened. This faculty member continued this behavior with the one other female graduate student on the panel, and became an entirely different person during our more senior male colleagues' presentations. This kind of behavior doesn't seem to be relegated to TV dramas like Mad Men; it's just a little disconcerting to see it happen in real time (to you!) in 2015. "male,natural,Small Liberal Arts College,"Female PhD Graduate student sent a picture of a male professor's penis on more than one occasion with solicitation for sex on text to cell phone on purpose (intended recipient). Professor was not tenured at the time, went to HR and title IX investigation was opened. He got a warning and two years later got tenure. "male,natural,Elite Institution/Ivy League,"1) A member of my committee joked leeringly about an undergraduate student (who happened to be a famous film actress) who petitioned to take his seminar, insinuating he was thrilled to enroll her because she was so hot.2) I was privy to the men in my male-dominated cohort basically ranking the women in our program by looks and explaining that they tolerated stupid remarks from women colleagues according to the speakers' attractiveness.3) A member of my dissertation committee told his cousin (who lived in my building) that he was infatuated with me; she passed this along and it was incredibly demoralizing feeling that all he liked about me was how I looked--though this proved true.4) As a jr. colleague, my chair told me that he imagined walking down the halls with one new female assistant professor on one arm and another on the other; he was fantasizing about basking in their reflected attractiveness. It was again demoralizing to feel that women cwere appreciated primarily for their appearance, not their contribution to the program. I worried a lot about tenure in this climate. "male,NotAvailable,Other Type of School,"Riding in an elevator at a hotel hosting the American Astronomical Society meeting many years ago, I had a Billy Bush and Al Franken moment. Another man and I boarded the elevator. As the doors were closing, a female graduate student boarded; she stood between us and the door. We all faced forward, toward the door. For no apparent reason, except perhaps to show he was one of the guys and maybe had had too much to drink, the other man pretended to grab her ass and looked at me for my ""locker room"" approval of his antics. I admit that I smiled and suppressed a chuckle so that she wouldn't hear. Now I would frown disapprovingly, but then I admitted to playing the role of ""of one the guys."" She never knew what happened. No one else was there. The man has since become a very powerful person, the Director of a major Institute in North America. Since she was (and is) unaware of what happened, I am unsure if this is harassment but I suppose it would be contributing to a hostile work environment if I felt it did. But it was at a conference hotel after the reception, so not really at a work function. It was just juvenile - but he was in his thirties. The key thing is that it was years ago and now that man is a powerful and apparently good leader of the field - an ally of the cause of equality for women in STEM. Everyone would say he's one of the ""good guys"" but I remember this incident."male,social&humanities,Small Liberal Arts College,"This is not an example of sexual harassment, but I've included it as it's a hard-to-categorise example of how young female students of colour may be taken advantage of sexually. It's a long story with some terrible details, but here's a summary (which is still quite long).I am an East Asian female graduate student, who began a close polyamorous relationship with a white male graduate student in my first year of studies (Fall 2015). He is three years senior to me, and is writing his dissertation on feminism. It started off as a good relationship, and he was only seeing me when we became involved. I had no reason not to trust him (he expressed very radical and progressive views on race, feminism, and sexuality), and was happy for him to begin seeing other people.But in the short span of a few months, it slowly but surely escalated into a situation where he was (1) sleeping with two other East Asian women on campus, (2) had slept with two other East Asian women on trips overseas, and (3) was sexting a half-Asian woman who was in another country. Before meeting, he had also been involved with several Asian woman. One of them was an female undergraduate in philosophy he saw when he was already a graduate student, and their relationship ended terribly for her.The fetishistic nature of all of this slowly got to me, and it was emotionally devastating as he was someone I had come to trust. Our relationship deteriorated and ended very badly. There was a lot of gaslighting involved, and many attempts to make me feel guilty and blame the other women involved, but I eventually realised that he was the one with the problem.The relationship ended extremely badly, and I developed PTSD shortly afterwards. I was afraid to be on campus and in my department, for fear of seeing him and the other women on campus. He also lives right next to the department (his room can be seen a short distance away from the main entrance). The PTSD was debilitating, and has affected me from Spring 2016 to now (Fall 2017). It set back my work and personal life in many ways. Amongst other symptoms, I had multiple panic attacks daily. My mental health problems were exacerbated by my knowledge that he was literally being paid to do research on feminism.As no crime or policy violation had been committed, the department could do nothing other than to offer me psychological support, and extensions on incomplete work. I am thankful for them. After a long journey, I was finally told a week ago by my therapist that I no longer fit the diagnostic criteria for PTSD. There is still work to be done, and it is still difficult to sit in the same room as him as I am often forced to do. But I am proud of the progress I've made, and look forward to getting even better."male,applied&formal,"More Than One Institution (feel free to elaborate in ""Comments"")","There is a senior male scholar in my field who regularly--compulsively even--oversteps boundaries with most women he encounters in professional settings. Over the past decade (and I know from senior colleagues that this has gone on much longer), I have both experienced and witnessed inappropriate behavior from him on multiple occasions at conferences, invited talks, etc., including: 1. excessively touching/stroking women's arms, shoulders, and backs, 2. giving out French ""bisous"" that just happen, as if by accident, to land on the recipient's lips, 3. handing out his phone number with a casual invitation to visit him at his hotel later. "male,applied&formal,Elite Institution/Ivy League,I was touched by someone I did not want touching me. I was also subjected to crude remarks in public.male,social&humanities,Elite Institution/Ivy League,"Three different incidents in three different Canadian universities as I worked towards my doctorate in Englisht Language and Literature. The first involved several approaches by a professor to join his ""groupies"" to share wine and literary discussion. I believe one or more of my peers became his paramour and I was a distinct outsider for not joining in. Their marks were quite high!The second was more serious and involved being stalked by a professor in the department who made several attempts to get in to my apartment accompanied by compliments and then pleas to pursue a relationship and which was only stopped by threats of exposure by my fellow student and myself. Interestingly, while he was not one of my profs, his best friend gave me the lowest mark in the class (all my other marks were in the ""A"" range.)The third incident may have cost me a position as an assistant professor when I rejected the advances of one of the professors on the hiring committee who had invited me into his office after the interview. This included removing his hand from my knee."male,natural,Elite Institution/Ivy League,"My professor was so happy to start working with me on my Ph.D. Shortly after I started working with him something very odd happened. I wanted to work on a topic and he emplored me to use only a certain source - a new ""Anchor Bible Dictionary"". I told him I was beyond the stage of relying on a dictionary and should be using primary sources. He insisted. I wrote a paper based on his ""advice"" Later, when others were given teaching appointments I was denigned. Years later an encounter with another professor of mine shed light on his odd request. He had taken the paper based on this limited dictionary to the chair and complained to him of my poor quality work. This set the scene for his control over me. To make a long story short he attempted to corner me, even going as far at to tell me that I had an extension to submit my final Ph. D. manuscript. I recorded his conversation with me on the phone. He was the Graduate Advisor of our department so there was no way he was making a mistake. I called the Faculty of Graduate Studies and found out I didn't have an extension. I didn't need one. I am one of the few Ph.D. candidates who submitted their manuscript without approval from their Supervisor. I have no clear idea what he was up to however I had been warned to avoid him but no one ever told me why. Once I realized that something very odd and manipulative was going on, I felt that he was trying to manuoever me into a situation where he would be totally in control and I would be desparate and to anything to get out of it. The only thing I could imagine that he was up to was sexual in nature, although he never insinuated anything. His behaviour, the isolation and ostricization he manufactored is highly suspect. "male,classics,Other R1,"I was in my last semester of my undergraduate degree and writing my thesis. My married much older thesis supervisor told me he was in love with me and he was 'open to whatever I was open to.' I had been without parental contact for two years and he knew - I worked three part time jobs, including for him, for several years. He was the only ongoing adult in my life (I was 24 and he was 50). I had feelings for him but looking back they were ridiculously idealized and based on neediness for adult support. We got involved and under the terrible stress of it I dropped to 89 pounds. I tried to end things once a week and he would go into hysterics contacting me, escalating in urgency and threats to hurt himself until I contacted him back. He told me not to tell anyone - roommates, friends, other faculty - because he said the real trouble with involvements was the perception that I would not have earned my grades. He also made sure I knew he was friends with the Dean and the President of the University. I froze on the writing of my thesis. The term ended and I still could not bring myself to write. He urged me to finish, saying he could not wait to 'get his hands on me when I was done.' (We had not had intercourse but were sexually involved). Ultimately he spent a week in my room sitting beside me as I wrote so he could make sure I finished. The day I handed in my thesis I moved back to my parent's home, even though it was not a safe or healthy environment for me. I was one course away from finishing a Physical Science degree as well, and my plan had been to finish that during the summer, but I left to get away from him. I started a joint Masters-PhD program and was still confused and kept in touch with him, but while trying to maintain boundaries which he did not respect. I saw him in person once and he pressured me and would not take no for answer for sexual activity. I finally got help, blocked his number and he became hysterical and blamed this on 'people who were influencing me.' He contacted faculty and other grad students at my new university to ask questions about me. I fell into a deep two year major depression and never finished my Masters."male,social&humanities,Other R1,"Professor slept with his advisee, and in turn heaped free stuff and praise on her. After a student complaint, he was told to ""knock it off"" by the university but was allowed to keep advising her. Changed his tune and made meetings hugely uncomfortable by openly criticizing her to other students and mocking her failure to make progress."male,social&humanities,Elite Institution/Ivy League,"Several incidents that included myself and several women, including a full professor, in my department. First incident began when I was an MA student. I knew him from classes and he seemed harmless enough. He asked for my number to discuss coursework and then he began to text me constantly. He would ask to come over or invite me over; I then found out he was going through a divorce. He wouldn't take no for an answer. He borrowed one of my books to scan for class and asked about ""Netflix and chilling"" when I asked to get my book back. I politely declined. Soon afterwards, he yelled at me in public after an unofficial department event and promised he ""wasn't going to rape"" me. He got really angry. I quickly left and turned off my phone because he kept texting me. I filed a Title IX after this and began to avoid him at all opportunities. We had two classes and he tried to ""talk"" to me about what happened. The Title IX coordinator didn't file anything. When I filed a Title IX the second time, she couldn't even find my file and then, once she had found it, claimed that I was ""more concerned for his well being."" No, I wanted to be safe. In other cases in my department, he has done similar things to students who were younger than him. He also ""accidentally"" showed his penis at an unofficial department function. Several female students saw it. He has been known to be openly hostile to female professors; his whole body language and attitude changes when talking to them, especially when one even potentially challenges his authority. One professor filed a Title IX against him. Our Title IX coordinator did nothing the first time 3 women and 1 professor reported him; she hardly did anything the second time several women filed a Title IX complaint. "male,social&humanities,Elite Institution/Ivy League,"I was a female PhD student who was also working full time. I still had office space in my academic department and shared the office with my supervisor's new post-doctoral student. This post-doc indicated interest in my PhD project as well as my external job. Often after work I would come into the office to work on my PhD and the post-doc would also be working. The post-doc suggested collaborating on a number of projects and I was very excited by the prospect of professional collaboration, as the research sounded very interesting and might lead to publications. The post-doc then thought that because we spent time together discussing research as well as personal matters and news/popular culture, and occasionally shared a meal in a public restaurant, that meant we were ""going out"", that I was his girlfriend; he repeatedly tried to put his arm around me or to hold hands with me. Every time this happened I said that I was not his girlfriend and that I wanted to keep the relationship professional. He said he would be going to another country for another postdoc and he asked me to join him after I was finished my PhD, so that we could collaborate. He said he would pay all expenses. He offered to help me finish my PhD by writing one or more chapters, and by paying my tuition. I declined his offer and reminded him that I was not his girlfriend. I told him that I was disappointed that he had turned a cordial professional relationship into something that made me very uncomfortable. I stopped doing my PhD work in the office unless I knew that he would not be there, and I tried to avoid him whenever possible. He left to do his other postdoc and much international traveling, and he kept sending me letters and gifts for years afterwards, from all over the globe. I never replied to or acknowledged his mail. In some of the early letters, he declared his undying love for me and repeatedly asked when I would be joining him so that we could be together. I stopped reading the letters. I did not finish my PhD and stayed working full time, then quit my job and moved to another country for another full-time job. I was glad to be so far away from him in a location where he could not easily find me or contact me directly. Colleagues who were not aware that I was not interested in correspondence from him forwarded me mail that he sent to me at the University. The postdoc has sent the occasional message to me over the years through LinkedIn, although we are not Linked. The messages have been personal but without romantic overtones. Over twenty years later, I am now in an academic position in my original country, and recently received an email from the former postdoc (at my work email) to let me know that he is starting a new PhD (in an unrelated field to his postdoc area of study) at a University in a city that is not very far from where I live now. I am not concerned, but I do not understand why he continues to make contact; I have never replied to any of his mail or emails. I should demand that he leave me alone and never contact me again by any means, but it would mean making some sort of contact with him to do this, and I am concerned he will misinterpret this as some kind of interest in him. "male,social&humanities,Elite Institution/Ivy League,"He was a visiting professor at my university who returned later to a neighboring institution. It was well-known that he hit on his students, especially the undergrads. I don't know how much these lopsided power relations were consensual but I have always felt uncomfortable that I remained silent. Only much later did I realize how widespread this kind of behavior was by him as well as by several other male faculty in the departments he visited (at both institutions). It's clear that his sexual come-ons to his students were part of a pattern of harassment that both departments/universities tolerated. Male students, even the lackluster ones, were mentored by him. Meanwhile, almost all the female students, especially the smartest ones, he tried (often successfully) to have sex with. This division of attentions permeated interactions well beyond his specific 'affairs' but he was not the only faculty member in those departments to abuse trust and practice inegalitarian treatment of their students."male,social&humanities,Elite Institution/Ivy League,"A professor requested my friendship on Facebook when I was in his class. He also requested the friendship of another young woman in the class and nobody else. He posted on our walls suggestively. He showed up at her work when she was bartending a propositioned her for sex. He told me he no longer has sex with his wife. He texted her his room number at a conference. I told my ""feminist professor"" about this and she just told him about it and he made fun of me for complaining.

He told me this while we were working on my poster presentation the next day in my hotel room. this is not an uncommon occurrence as typically him and all his students work in someone's room at a conference, but I suddenly realized that i was alone in the room with him and that he was now a threat. I was terrified. I politely declined, but it took a good hour of discussion to convince him that I didn't feel the same way.

It was professional and productive the whole time and on the overnight trip we stayed in separate rooms at a hotel. He paid for both rooms and for all meals. When we returned late at night from the weekend of sampling, he dropped me off in the parking lot on campus where my car was parked. Before I exited the vehicle, he put his hand on my leg and bent forward to kiss me. I turned my head and he kissed me on the cheek. He said he had romantic intentions and wanted to start an affair. He confessed that he had had an affair some years previously with one of this graduate students but that because I was no longer his student nor employee, that it would be OK to be with him.

In fact he didn't actually teach much so I tried to pick up the slack for the sake of the students.

He repeatedly told me to come to his office for conferences, but I was able often to find ways to avoid being alone with him by having someone with me, or meeting with him in the hallway. I didn't escape his groping and uninvited kissing entirely, but he must have seen through my evasive techniques because he gave my work a B+, the only grade below a solid A I ever received throughout my graduate work at U of Arizona and U of Wisconsin.

I found the transition from graduate school, which I found to be collegial and enjoyable, to the highly competitive world of American academia to be very difficult. Sometime in my second year at WSU I was reading one of Jane Goodal's books. I was sitting in a faculty when I suddenly realized that I was surrounded by a classic primate male dominance pecking order, and that I was the male at the bottom. Until I had arrived at WSU I had been a quite successful student and postdoc, so needless to say I found my new position to low status to be difficult. The department had quite dysfunctional dynamics at the time and quite a lot of energy was expended by the faculty making sure that everyone stayed in their place in the pecking order. I did notice that the two women in the department were treated differently. They were not so much part of the pecking order, and for this I envied them. I simply wanted to be valued for who I was and to make a contribution. The environment was not encouraging and I often felt humiliated. I did not thrive this environment. I left after four years. After a lot of soul searching and with guidance from the book ""What Color is My Parachute"" I was able to redirect my life. I have since had quite successful career in industry.

At first I thought he was trying to be nice or helpful, but his comments got creepier and creepier. Then, he started to touch me more than the male students in the lab. First it was just a hug to celebrate a milestone now and then, but soon he was insisting that he drive me the one mile between class and the lab and then he started to rest his hand on my shoulder the whole way. Then, one day his hand slipped under the collar of my shirt and he commented on how soft my skin was. I tried to avoid him more and more but the gradual nature of his harassment and his complete control over my academic future made it difficult to confront him directly. Shortly after that, he asked me to practice a presentation in his hotel room during a conference and pulled me onto his lap while I was speaking.

Eventually I agreed to become involved. He disclosed he was also involved with two other women in our faculty (one woman was untenured) and had been for several years. When I tried to get out of the situation and refused to share a hotel room with him, he said he had 'gone to the wall for me' regarding my application for a promotion. I did get out of the situation, but I did not report it.

Initially, I was thrilled that he took an interest in showing me the ropes of academia because I was in my early PhD program years and my faculty advisor was on sabbatical. The questions and discussion on post-PhD program plans slowly lead to his commentary and questions on my dating life (and hints at who I was intimate with), my appearance, my plans for marriage and children (hinting at me getting older and getting on with the process ASAP). This carried on for years. The inquiries of my dating life came sporadically but when they did, they were very intrusive with an underlying tone of questioning who I was intimate with. Some other extremely uncomfortable exchanges happened, with him showing up to events that were student only gatherings that he happened to _岩serendipitously_ come upon. Questioning me about dating a fellow classmate and asking if my relationship with my classmate was intimate. I refused to answer and he insisted that I tell him. l I received an invitation to a social outing which I interpreted as a date and I froze. I was scared and appalled that this confirmed my fears that he may be interested in me, but I was too scared to tell him he had crossed the line. Not knowing what could come of it, I immediately distanced myself. When possible, I avoided meetings where I knew he would be or I would arrive a bit late so that I would be able to pick a seat away from him. I started missing meetings or shying away from certain conference activities to avoid him. The final day that I was a student, he came to sit next to me to congratulate me and touched my leg above my knee. I sat there, motionless, glad that it would soon be over because I was done and I would never come back or have to deal with him getting too close to me, or touching me, or commenting on my looks ever again.

This made me very uncomfortable. The ex professor's friend called me 10+ times a day asking me to introduce him to girls in my university but I told both of them that no girl is interested (I did not ask any women). The ex-prof then told me that his friend thinks ""I am the hottest"", and soon the friend started asking me to sleep with him, started soliciting me for sex.

"female,NotAvailable,Other R1,"As a PhD student, I found myself mired in icky ambiguously sexual circumstances with 2 different professors. The least awful was a professor who held his final seminar session in a bar over pitchers of beer & then invited me to for a bite to eat afterward. I hoped we were going to talk about my project & thought surely he meant we'd grab a burger or some quick Thai food. But then he walked me into an expensive white table cloth restaurant and proceeded to order appetizers and wine and all these things he surely knew I could not afford. So reluctantly and awkwardly I let him pay, which made me feel crazy. After, he casually said let's go to my place to finish talking about your paper & I really really really wanted to go home but didn't know how to say that and felt so strange about having been treated to such an expensive meal. It sounds insane but I couldn't figure out how to get out of this night with him. It was all so confusing b/c in class he talked all the time about his kids and wife (""my wife"" and never by name. She was a fairly visible feminist & in hind sight, I see that he leveraged her feminism all the time to position himself as a feminist. UGH.) Anyway, I felt terribly embarrassed to be taking this as a date when he had made himself out to be such a family man & felt confused about how to extract myself, especially because I was still hoping for help in publishing the essay I had written for his seminar and that I cared so passionately about. That was icky but it was only 1 seminar and 1 grade at stake. More shattering was the next year when I was promoted from graduate teaching assistant to the prized fellowship everyone wanted - assistant editor to a very prestigious journal. The editor, my boss and a leading feminist, was both gate-keeper in my field and now boss of my graduate fellowship. She held in hand, then, both my immediate daily survival and the keys to my future, a future I had leveraged with considerable student loans. Although my fellowship contract obligated me to provide 20 hours a week of editing work, my boss expanded the duties to include coordinating dry cleaning, car repairs, credit card disputes, out-out-town fee-based speaking engagements and travel plans, etc. I wasn't allowed to go home for winter break b/c it was time to copy edit the galleys. This makes no sense b/c the journal was published in Baltimore by Johns Hopkins & we were editing on the west coast. So what did it matter where I finished the galleys? My boss never looked at the articles after the initial content editing was done anyway so it's not like we needed to collaborate. What I'm trying to explain is how I felt a little imprisoned, almost indentured. Sexual harassment was the cherry on top of this toxic covenant. I felt uncomfortable all the time & started wearing baggy clothing, which my boss hated. One time in front of my peers, she mocked the overalls I was wearing, exclaiming, ""I can fit a fist in your pants"" and then proceeded to shove not 1 but 2 fists into my crouch, right there in front of everyone. Another time at a conference, after I had just presented my paper and people were swarming to congratulate and ask me questions, she interrupted everything to spank me, right there in front of my peers and prospective future employers. I was mortified and I swear my brain stayed frozen for many days after that incident. I was so stuck and had sacrificed everything for this opportunity to study so I thought I had to accept the behavior. I thought I was managing but was so surprised each morning to discover that my pillow was wet. I lived in a crappy apartment so naturally I looked for a ceiling leak that might be the source of the wet pillow. Honestly, I really thought it was caused by an environmental leak until I finally realized my pillow was soggy from the salt tears I had been weeping in my sleep. I guess my conscious hours were so completely indentured that the only time I could cry was during sleep. I was trapped in a viciously competitive environment and so we students carefully guarded our secrets from each other. (Tragically, then, we didn't support each other or warn one other of possible hazards.) For this reason, I suspect but can not confirm that at least 2 other women in my program also may have experienced sexual coercion and harassment. One of them may have been in an even more precarious position than me b/c she was on a student visa and needed this professor's support to maintain her visa status. I completed my degree because I_验m not a _岩quitter._ But I never asked for a letter of recommendation and I never once checked to see what jobs might be available in my field. All I could do was flee the entire sphere of influence. I paid off my student loans by working in a field unrelated to my training and in fact one for which a college degree is entirely unnecessary. I maintain that the abuse changed the course of my life, a fact about which I am still bitter.I_验m telling you this now for several reasons.1. I_验m tired of holding it in my body and am ready to release this bitterness.2. I believe that young students are vulnerable and should be entitled to a safe place in which to complete their educations.3. College & graduate students are impressionable; the reality is that they are being cultivated as future workers & bosses in every sector of our economy. In this way, sexual misconduct on our campuses contributes to and perpetuates an insidious culture of harassment which spreads throughout the entire economy. For this reason, campus abuse has the potential to harm all workers, not just college students and graduates. 4. Although I am grateful for my education and believe that you can never foreclose on the knowledge and thinking skills I carry in my head, technically I don_验t use my education because I felt too traumatized to pursue the career I studied. 5. My education was partially funded with public dollars which subsidized my graduate fellowship and student loans. One could argue this public investment was wasted because I never attempted to work in the field for which I trained. If you buy my statement that I was deterred by systematic abuse, that is an egregious betrayal of the public trust & resources.

He started asking me to come to events, to which I believed other people would go as well. These occasions turned out just being me and him leaving me to feel uncomfortable, as he was clearly trying to single me out. I kept mentioning my long-term partner of 9 years to highlight that I have no interest whatsoever in anything other than professional exchange. During supervision meetings I placed my bag on the chairs next to me, so he couldn't sit too close. He sent several emails, complimenting on/or using vulgar language about my body parts. As ""welcome"", he patted me on the head in front of students I was supposed to give a lecture to. Perplexed about what happened I simply overrode the deep embarrassment and simply gave the lecture in the hope nobody noticed it. He patted me another time on the head at a school exhibition opening, where I finally had the guts to ask him to stop this behaviour. His response was: ""But this is the only accessible part of your body?"". My reply: ""NO part of my body is accessible to you!"". After this, I reported him to my research department since the behaviour got worse and his harassment more invasive. I stopped avoiding him and remained as professional as much as I could, but my dismissal just made him come on stronger. He tried to kiss me at the end of the last supervision meeting I ever had with him, walking all across the room towards me before I've almost left the space. I prevented the kiss and walked off, fuming, of course. The other second supervisor that time, made inappropriate and sleazy comments about my physical appearance (my legs, staring overly long at my chest and between my legs), offered zero practical advice with regards to the PhD and boasted at public events in front of others that he won't read my writing anyway as he had ""more important things to do"". I had nobody to talk to and felt utterly ashamed that this was happening to me. My initial reports to the research department were only met with disbelief and embarrassment, but no concrete advise or action followed the report. My avoidance of the two supervisors soon turned the atmosphere sour, so the backlashes started to happen: the supervisor now tried to boycott an exam, a promised lecturer position fell all of a sudden through, he called on my private mobile phone only to shout at me for minutes. He started side-lining me, shared my confidential research documents with his other PhD students without permission and started using my work for his course development.

I ignored the allusions. When my committee member ultimately tried to have my thesis defense scuttled, I relied on him to protect my work. He did. Following the successful defense, he stated outright that the next time we saw each other he expected that I would have sex with him. Because his reputation preceded him, his defense of my work taints my work regardless of the fact that I did not engage in anything but a professional, academic relationship with him.

While we were standing at a bar table, a senior professor (+/- 60 years old) joined us and started talking to my friend, the only other female at the table. She quickly felt uncomfortable, moved around the table, as a result of which the senior professor came standing next to me and started a conversation. While talking, he made an unappropriate comment how I should work for him. During this conversation, he carressed my hand, touched my back, and eventually stroked my ass. At that point, I stiffened. My female friend saw what happened and pulled me away, leaving the reception."male,social&humanities,Other Research Agency,"As a job candidate on a campus visit, male members of the department staff entered my hotel room against my explicitly expressed wishes. On two different occasions (is this a thing?) (It was early 2000s, so I'm hoping things have changed...)In the first campus visit, my unwelcome guest followed me to the room after I picked up the key at the hotel reception desk. He had been helping me by pulling my (very small) wheelie-bag. Once I had my key, I told him 'thanks so much, I'll take it from here.' He responded by not handing the bag over, but proceeding down the hall toward the room, the number of which he evidently knew. At the door of the room, I thanked him again and expressed my gratitude for his having met me at the airport etc. and told him I was looking forward to continuing our discussion of local colonial history over dinner. I reached for my bag which he relinquished. I then pulled it over towards me, turned, and opened the door. He then held the door open for me as I pulled the bag in to the room. I stopped, turned back, and said, 'thanks again' only to have him push past me into the hotel room. I had told him - three times - that I didn't want him in my hotel room, despite whatever pedagogical benefit he thought his presence my have for me. In the room, he stood by the bed and explained the history of the view out the window. I interjected to tell him I was tired after my flight and needed to rest/freshen up before meeting the person driving me to the dinner. I walked back and stood at the room door, holding it open. He left.I didn't think this was 'sexual harassment' so much as just plain rude. So I wrote this first incident off as 'just weird', figuring they'd sent someone with poor social skills who thought it would be more important for me to understand local economy history as written in the landscape than feel safe and have my boundaries respected. Not someone I necessarily wanted to have as a colleague, but, ok, whatever.... At least they let me know this guy likely wouldn't listen to me on any other matter either....On the second visit - same thing, campus visit for a TT position - this happened after the obligatory second night's more informal dinner with grad students and faculty. So I was already exhausted from a 22 hour long-haul flight, the research presentation, interview, teaching demonstration, first breakfast meeting, meeting with the Dean, meeting with grad students, and a trip to a local attraction, we had this last dinner. And, after dinner, Prof A suggested we go on to a pub that was on the walking route back to my hotel. Since I was in one of those disciplines where there's a culture of pub-going and it's very important, in terms of perceived 'fit', for a female candidate to show she has a sense of humour and can hold a drink, I knew this was still the 'fit' part of the interview. After what I thought was two rounds of drinks, it was arranged that Prof A would walk me back from the pub to the hotel - short distance, but easy to get lost and 'not safe' for a woman alone. I had a breakfast meeting the next morning, then that was it - my breakfast interviewer, Prof B, would take me directly to the airport afterwards. Prof A and I had been discussing teaching and pedagogy in our research area and how to integrate research into undergrad teaching over our post-dinner drink. As we walked up to the front of my hotel, I suggested I could pass on some course outlines I'd put together but not circulated during my interview. These covered areas of pedagogical strategy we'd discussed in the pub and he could add them to the file the selection panel would review. Total mistake.The course outlines were in the 'interview folder' I'd left in my hotel room earlier that even. So we walked Into the hotel lobby and I motioned to the chairs in the reception area and told him 'please wait here, I'll only be a minute.' He ignored that and followed me on to the elevator. His lack of response to my directions showed me he was clearly more inebriated than I had initially thought. Despite my telling him to wait at the elevator, he followed me to the room door. I couldn't believe this was actually happening (again), but I didn't want to be rude (or violent.) Despite my telling him, even more firmly to 'wait at the door' and pulling it so it would close behind me - in his face - he pushed the door open, came into the room, and then stretched out on the bed.... So I gave him the course outlines by tossing them on top of his chest. Then I told him 'you need to go home NOW', relieved that the room layout meant I could easily sprint for it and lock myself in the bathroom. Thanks be, he finally got the message and left. By the time I got to breakfast with Prof B, I was furious that I'd found myself in that position while ON A CAMPUS VISIT JOB INTERVIEW.

I heard from other students that he had made disparaging comments about my body; then I learned he was also dating his other mentee who happened to be especially slender. There was nearly a full a semester of these horrible exchanges with him before I knew this was the reason behind his disdain for me. In the final review he smugly wrote in my evaluation as a criticism of me that I had fewer women participating in my class (there were something like 23 male students and 2-3 female students in this particular class), but did not bother to note the ways in which I encouraged the participation of the few women to specifically mitigate that imbalance. All this in the larger context of The program I was in, which was certainly a boys' club--a fellow female student and I were once severely chastised by a tt asst prof for whispering during class (we had a presentation coming up but class time was being mismanaged by the previous presenter--a male student who could do no wrong in the eyes of the professors--we were whispering to decide what to cut from our presentation). Certain male students could turn in slipshod work--one repeatedly wrote his on napkins--and it would still be praised. My tenured full Advisor would comment on female students appearance regularly and other female grad students sometimes boasted about using this to their advantage either by dressing provacatively when meeting with him and/or crying in his office hours, which somehow we all knew was something persuasive to him.

A very senior, famous colleague was standing next to me. He put his arm around me in an apparent gesture of bonhomie or collegiality and his hand went down to my waist. He then pinched my waist.

It was disgusting "male,NotAvailable,Other R1,"As a young assistant professor at an art school I noticed an older adjunct faculty member who would lurk in the halls or appear out of nowhere and stare. Other colleagues agreed he was ""creepy."" Fast forward 10 years. I was now department chair and it came to my attention that this same guy, who taught poetry writing, was making female undergraduates pretty uncomfortable. Rather than teaching everyone together in a classroom, he held tutorials in his tiny office with the door closed so that he could work with each individual student on her writing. One student came forward when she received an envelope of poems at her home address (which she had not shared with him -- he had gotten the registrar to tell him where she lived). Although he would deny it, the poems were highly suggestive and personal, mentioning, for example, a tattoo on her leg and the street she lived on. He also called her on her cell phone and asked her questions about her boyfriend. He would have students bring some of their art to class so he could help them translate their inspiration into words; in her case he honed in on a photograph in which she appeared in the background, in the shadows, partly nude. (This was in that tiny office with the door closed.) The student filed a complaint, and I had her taken out of the class and asked another colleague to work with her through the rest of the semester so that she could get credit for the course. This was just the first incident. This student filed a complaint which was adjudicated through a complex system that included both the in-house sexual harassment procedure and the state-wide faculty union grievance process. His defense was that he was working very hard with each student to draw out their creative energy based on what he saw in their work, and of course, they explored all kinds of subjects in their work. The fact that they were 20 years old and he was somewhere in his 70s, supposedly mature enough to know where to draw the line, did not seem to register. He had several advocates in the department, all male and quite senior to me, who argued that his writing poems for the students was a matter of free speech, and that stopping it would cast a shadow over the principles of artistic freedom at the school. The poet was able to keep his job with a stern warning, an order not to have students in his office alone, and a remedial sexual harassment training program -- something required by state law that had not really been enforced for adjunct faculty, putting the university in a position of potential liability. He came to my office in the fall and told me he was very sorry, he now understood, and I would never have any trouble with him again. I told him I hoped he meant it. But of course he kept up the same behavior, choosing new students for his obsession each term. After the students saw that he had not been fired, they were very reluctant to bring new complaints against him, and feeling very upset that I had not been able to get justice for the first student, I did not feel I could push them to complain, as I could make no promises. I could only take the incident to the civil rights officer, but without a formal complaint we could go no further. Every time I went to him and told him I knew what he was up to, he wanted to know who complained, and whined about how he had a constitutional right to face his accuser. He denied and denied, and begged me not to take away the only meaningful thing left in his life. After a couple of these incidents he seems to have understood he couldn't do this with students in his class, but decided it would be ok to stalk random students he saw in the halls. Two years after my term was up, he turned his attention to a graduate student, followed her to the cafeteria, invited himself to have lunch with her, offered to help her with recommendations, etc. She didn't like it but she felt she had to be polite to a professor. Then he wrote a little play and e-mailed it to her. There was immediately a second e-mail saying ""maybe you shouldn't open that other e-mail but just delete it."" Naturally she opened it. It was very explicit. She brought it to public safety, who called HR, and at last he was escorted out of the building and banned from campus. The grievance procedure dragged on for over a year with his old friends declaiming over and over the violation of his civil rights, but the firing was upheld at last."male,social&humanities,Elite Institution/Ivy League,"I taught in an architecture program, which demands an intimate relationship with students in a studio setting. A professor in our program was repeatedly initiating unwanted advances and comments with female students. He was often found at student parties inebriated and harassing female students. On two occasions he went over the line:At a hotel stay during a field trip with students he insisted on hosting a party in his hotel room in his bathrobe. He apparently groped a student's breast in a drunken state. During a critique session with a female student (who it turns out had been traumatized at an early age), he started to discuss with her his stimulation preferences and how many fingers were appropriate for vaginal stimulation. Apparently this carried on for quite a while. Her colleagues were too intimidated and scared to say anything.

None of them is the professor accused in the recent Title IX case involving a History professor. One of the professors professed his love for me and was constantly stalking me as if to casually run into me and have an opportunity to strike a conversation and/or invite me for a date. He was notorious for pursuing graduate students in his department and no-one bat an eye when they saw him harassing me. He was a senior professor and my situation back them was typically quite vulnerable, especially when I became an international graduate student and had enormous sums to pay for my education. He helped me learn about fellowships and may have put in good word so that I won some of those, which put me in the delicate position of having to put up with his advances. The other professor, from my graduate program, would call me to his office regularly to theoretically discuss class work. In reality, he took that opportunity to harass me. He'd shut the door immediately after I would come in and then force a conversation about his youth and how much he'd like me, saying things like ""Had I known you when I was young...""

When he got up to leave he pushed me against a wall and pushed himself against me and put one of his hands around my throat as he made sexual advances.

I served as a TA for him; it was a large lecture class, and so he had to wear one of those microphones that clip on and are attached to a little battery pack. Most classes, he would ""accidentally"" drop the battery pack in his pocket before turning the mic on. He had a tremor, so there was a plausible excuse, but he would ask me (a) to unbutton his shirt to clip the microphone on properly and then (b) reach into his pocket to take out the battery pack and turn it on (I was then expected to put it back into his pocket). This felt super weird and creepy, but I went with it because he made it clear that there wasn't another choice. Sometimes, during class, he would ask me to step outside of the classroom with him (into this little vestibule). He'd put his hand on my arm, look deep in my eyes, tell me that it was time for a break and he was going to head to his office, and to tell the students to come back / expect him back in 15 minutes.

I waved at them as I rushed past to find a friend, the woman yelled as I went past about my ""flat abs and great body."" I glared at her. Later after she came up with a colleague of mine at my current institution and had him introduce her to me, she said the two men she was with before didn't want to and she suspected ""they were keeping me for themselves.""

The program was set in a way that through ongoing mentorship, research and creative production is developed. The mentor is given a healthy production budget to create work while accompanying the student/younger artist through the process of developing and creating their work. There are about 12 students in any given year and 4 mentors, leaving each mentor with 3 younger artists to follow and meet regularly with in the studio or as they feel fit. The institution invited a well known French filmmaker as a mentor. He had been accused on a number of accounts for sexual assault and abuse and was, at the time, being tried for an incident concerning a female young actress he had hired for a film. This man was invited to mentor young artists + film makers and was paired by the institution to work with me. To say the meetings were uncomfortable and inappropriate is an understatement. We met initially at the studio and since this generated in me feelings of discomfort at later dates we met in an office at the institution as to be in a more public setting. At each of our meetings we would be quite intoxicated and speaking inappropriately about my body and my work as a female performance artist. He gave no sound guidance or mentorship. We met a total of three times over the course of the year (the program is meant to be an opportunity for far more exchange) with his advances getting more direct each time. The other two young artists working with him felt similarly - a woman who was also experiencing harassement and a man who felt his mentorship was nothing more than a bar-like conversation. I stopped meeting with him all together and spoke with the director about my (our) experience. This was not addressed in anyway.

Also received an invite to check out this folk group this drummer liked. I agreed thinking it would be fun. We went the next evening to the show. I went with the intent of enjoying the show with a new friend. He was married and I had no interest in him other than a friend. That evening he offered to drop off a cd of a band he managed to see if it may be of interest to me to join. We made a plan to meet at a local coffee shop that following weekend. Before we met he emailed me an urged he needed to come by later than planned and would meet me at my place. I wouldn't normally let someone I hardly know stop by my place but where he was friends with my professor and was a professor himself I trusted him. Big mistake. Within 15 minutes of him entering my place he made a move. I told him I wasn't interested as he was a married man and I don't get involved with men in relationships. He apologized and we went back to talking. Then out of the blue he is pushing me down on the couch and forcing me to have sex threatening me the whole time. At one point I must have dissociated because I become aware of the fact he had turned the futon into a bed and was touching me. He didn't stop and leave until early the next morning.

We were in several classes together and through hints he managed to convince the professor I wanted to work with that we had had or were having a turbulent sexual relationship. We were not. 2) As an early assistant professor at a small conference, a peer at another institution--someone great, fun to talk to, very smart about language, and (of course?!) professedly unhappy in his home life--kept lightly touching me and finally less than lightly. I froze; he asked ""so, you don't like hugs?"" This person was married with several children and he knew I was going through a painful, confusing divorce. A very small incident, but memorable for me, because it felt like he had discerned--and was exploiting--both my (I thought, carefully hidden) personal sadness and my (out-in-the-open) intellectual desire for lively conversation within my field (which was hard to come by where I was teaching, and which I missed very much that first year after grad school).

I bring these three particular incidents up because--if things are changing--the supposedly gray areas need some attention, too. If a female colleague is friendly and animatedly discusses all the academic topics you like to animatedly discuss, it does not mean she wants to sleep with you! And if you want to test someone's attraction at a conference maybe just don't--but certainly don't touch her/shame her/test her in front of advisers/colleagues/conference-goers to see what she does, I more or less behaved like a deer in the headlights in all of these situations--nothing much career-wise or physical-safety-wise was at stake, yet I was flooded with fear and shame.

As such, graduate students compiled a petition asking for his removal from the board.

I had moved across the country from Nova Scotia specifically to work with him, because he was internationally recognized for his research on substance use. Prior to moving I spoke with two former students of his, who cautioned me against working with him because he was known to have a temper and didn't work well with women. I was 21 and alone in a new city. Initially he was very warm and we enjoyed a great rapport. He brought me on to exciting projects and we co-authored several papers together. He learned that I lived near his home and began suggesting that we have work meetings there, over a glass of wine. I was uncomfortable with these meetings, but felt obligated to go so I wouldn't miss out on research opportunities. The meetings frequently went from the professional to the personal, where he would share intimate details of his life with me: his failed marriage, the child he had co-parented, etc. I felt sorry for him and figured he was just another lonely, work-obsessed academic. I began to sense underlying tension and stress at our research center a few months in. I learned through the other RA's that my supervisor was known for being verbally abusive and was prone to screaming at them in person, sending late-night ranting emails, and accusing them of ""sabotaging"" his career. During my time at the center, two of his longest-serving RA's quit, and one of them shared her concerns with the Dean of the Faculty.

His other Master's student, a man, quit within 3 months of working with him. In my second year, my supervisor invited me to join him on an all-expenses-paid trip to Brazil to work on a collaborative research project. Over the 10-day trip we worked together all day, every day and stayed at the same hotel. He was in great spirits, and I felt like the ""chosen"" student. When I was leaving to return to Canada, he reached across the taxi and held my hand. I did nothing and tried to interpret it as a fatherly gesture. As I was leaving I mentioned I was excited to travel back to Nova Scotia in a few weeks to spend Christmas with my boyfriend. Things deteriorated as soon as I returned to Canada. I found a series of long, ranting emails that the other RA's had warned me about. He claimed I had made an error in a literature review that had humiliated him in front of our international collaborators, and accused me of being incompetent and trying to ruin his career. After a string of abusive emails, he cut off virtually all communication with me. I was in the middle of writing up my thesis and he made it clear that he would not be available to support my work. I was completely isolated. As Christmas came closer, he told me that I was too far behind to take holidays and that he didn't want me to leave. I did not share details of my travel plans with him, and left. He went found a printout of my travel itinerary at the office and send me a series of belligerent emails where he insisted that I needed to return immediately, claiming that he had left (long-awaited) feedback on my thesis at the office. I phoned my program chair in tears, telling her I needed to find another supervisor. She encouraged me to stay because my defense had already been scheduled and it would be better than starting over. I successfully defended my thesis, with a friend in the room for support. I could have pushed for a publication afterwards, but I didn't want to have any further contact with him. He made me feel like a failure. My friend (a man) started his PhD with my former supervisor a few months later, and quit shortly after experiencing a screaming tirade where he was insulted and threatened with physical violence (his exact words: ""I will kill you"".). In the years since, I've learned that his abuse was systemic and widely known within the research community (I always get a raised eyebrow from other academics when I mention his name). I found myself in a situation where I was totally powerless, had no institutional support and was subjected to verbal abuse and inappropriate romantic overtures from someone I trusted and admired. I know there are people who have experienced far worse, but I've found ways to minimize what happened to me for too long. This experience eroded my confidence in the integrity of the academic system to protect its students, and radically and permanently changed my career trajectory.

My mother had recently died, and I was then heading into a severe depressive disorder, a complete breakdown.

He would bicycle into work each day, and strip down to only his underpants, wipe his armpits and chest with a towel, and change into his work clothes for the day in his cubical area. Remember, this is an open-concept office, the cubical was just 2 low moveable walls, no door. We were all witness to his morning habits. I asked him twice to please change in the side-office, the one we used for consultations with students during work hours. He refused, stating that we were all adults, and in any case, I was married and familiar with the male human body. I had to resort to telling the head of our group, who in turn asked my co-worker to stop it. His response? He confronted me, and said I was upsetting the harmony in the office. I wish my male co-workers had stepped in as well. I'm not angry that they didn't. However I'm certain their input would have yielded better results. There were other similar ""one-of-the-boys"" type incidents, pretty much daily. Too many to catalogue. One that does stand out is the day he had Brazilian models doing a run-way show blaring from his computer, calling all the men over to have a look. They were all crowded around, and when I came in, the co-worker showing the video said I didn't need to be there; it wouldn't be my kind of thing. The crowd of guys quickly dispersed as soon as I arrived. I think they were embarrassed, and I'm certain they felt bad. Yet, they didn't call him out on his behaviour. Again, I wish they had.

I tried for about 8 months to navigate it without rocking the boat until I finally asked a committee member to intervene and take over my committee. During the process of removing him from my committee, which required a meeting with every-freaking-body, he then began to spread rumors that I was sleeping with the person I asked to take over my committee and that's why I wanted to change my committee. On the contrary, my eventual adviser has warned me that it would be war with this guy if I changed my committee. This guy was the graduate coordinator at the time and he 'disappaeared' numerous forms to claim I hadn't met deadlines, only to find them after I presented my own copies (multiple times). Anyone who vocally supported me was retaliated against; he had a lot of friends in high places and was the social center of the department at the time. I had only two faculty members in the end who spoke up for me. I had one write me 'poison pen' letters because I didn't realize she was an ally of his, more than a mentor of mine. It was horrible, I was blackballed for several years, I had to sneak around to apply for a Ph.D. program AND had to tell my prospective Ph.D. adviser about all of this before I even really knew her, I contemplated suicide, I contemplated leaving academics, and I had to worry for half a decade whether anybody thought I was a decent academic. I was so marginalized socially and professionally for years, it almost drove me out of the industry. I completely rolled over once speaking up incurred more abuse. I didn't know how to defend myself as a 20-something graduate student. I was astonished that everyone looked the other way with such ease.

As a mature student, an out lesbian of colour and a longstanding political activist I largely kept my distance from the social life of bars that was the cultural life of the largely white male marxists in the department. After two months of interesting course work I decided to attend a departmental event, reception and after-social at the pub. My professor suggested we sit at the bar away from the departmental crowd to have a chance to talk. Amidst an interesting political and intellectual exchange, a few drinks and laughs I turned to get something from my bag - when I turned back to the table he was suddenly right on me and without a word, question or notice started to french kiss me. I was stunned and picked him up by the shoulders and lifted him off me... asked him where his coat was - he said upstairs...

While I've explicitly rejected all of these behaviours lightheartedly (through sarcastic/joke type responses to his behaviours) and also more seriously when I realized the subtlety wasn't working, I also think I have contributed to the tone of the interactions in a few moments - hence my uncertainty that it's harassment.

It started by him trying to get me in a spot socially at the campus bar or at events where he could talk personally with me. He was extra nice, complimentary to the point of it being flirtatious and it felt creepy. He always seemed to be nearby. I recall walking down the hall on my way to class one day and he walked by and made a comment about my boots, and how sexy they looked on me. I felt like I couldn't even dress my usual way. He got my cellphone number from one of my male classmates without my permission and called several times late at night, each time I said no to grabbing a drink and after that he gave up. I made it quite clear I was not interested. My roommate knew this was going on and she had heard another student in our program was going through the same thing and was going to report it. Fastforward 6 months I graduated and was working in a different city and got a call from that roommate. A group of female students from the university were wanting me to join then in reporting my experience because there were now a number of stories coming out about the guy. I didn't want to go there, I was busy trying to make rent and find a stable job. I just didn't think it would be all that beneficial to me. It's been 10 years and I still think about that asshole and regret not speaking up. Not for me but for future female students just trying to get through their schooling which is hard enough. Then to have a member of the faculty actually interfering, making you feel creeped out and uncomfortable is just unacceptable.

We invited [redacted] to be our keynote speaker for this event, and I was incredibly excited to talk to him about his work since I respect it so much. The first day I met him, I was excitedly talking about a new book that had just come out, and how it intersected with his work and my own when he interrupted me and asked ""Do you have a partner that helps you with this?"" I was confused and hurt, and responded ""um, absolutely not. I do all of my own work."" He replied ""I'm trying to ask if you're single or not, that's all."" I didn't know what to do since I was shocked for several reasons: one being that he is very public about his marriage and his children, and two, because I was caught off guard. This was the first of many incidents that week with him. I kept trying to keep my other male-identified friends around me, but they also did not understand what the big deal was. I told the group at one point ""[redacted] keeps trying to sleep with me,"" and my ""friend"" said ""awesome, you should do it!""

He lied to me and told me he was getting divorced. I told my friends I didn't want him in my car, and the other event organizer said ""god dammit just take him to xxx's house.""

One day he asked about what we think when a _焉hunk_验 walks by. He would also make objectifying statements about women. When I complained about it he would tell me that some feminist theologians think that we need to be talking about push up bras and sexuality. He never respected me as a theologian and made clear his amusement of me, particularly when a male classmate made a disparaging remark towards me. My classmates look up to him and he has a good reputation in the community as a pastor. He claims to be a women_验s advocate. I doubted my own experiences until he finally commented on my _岩slinky dress,_ (I was wearing a modest sleeveless blouse behind a podium) in a photo of me at a public speaking event at a local church. He also made fun of a mutual friend and colleague because I had expressed admiration for him as a chaplain (which is the field I_验m preparing for.) He would encourage us to speak up and then remind us that the faculty have so much power over grades, and professional/academic recommendations."male,social&humanities,Other R1,sexual assault in 2013male,social&humanities,Other R1,"I was harassed by my supervisor. His office was being moved, so he used this as an excuse to set our first meeting off campus on a Friday afternoon--we met at a bar. He also postponed our meeting into the evening. Another time he recommended that we see a film that was tangentially related to my work. He suggested that we meet at a theatre near my apartment. After the film, he sent me an email saying that he was hoping to ""receive more hospitality,"" which I assume was a reference to the fact that I didn't invite him to my place. At one of our meetings, he mentioned being accused of harassing undergraduates. These stories continued until I received my grades and my degree, which is when I stopped responding to him. "male,NotAvailable,Elite Institution/Ivy League,"I was sexually harassed and assaulted by my music instructor in graduate school. The private music lesson is an intimate space--with just a professor/instructor and a student in a small room. Over the course of the academic quarter, the instructor would touch my arms, hands, and lower back in a way that was being masked as the pedagogical teaching of technique. He would also make sexually suggestive comments with respect to my playing style or the music. In the middle of the quarter, I was invited to his house for dinner, and I attended with the understanding that his female roommate (an adjunct lecturer in the department) would be home. She was not. Things started to become awkward after dinner, when he asked me to sit on the couch. I have repressed exactly what happened next, but I did end up leaving his house abruptly once I started to feel like I was in danger. The next time I saw him on campus, he grabbed me and kissed me forcefully. I was so shocked and disturbed by all that had happened, I ended up dropping the course immediately. He then started to call me incessantly --so much so that I felt I should change my phone number. Later, I learned that he was exerting similar predatory behavior to other Asian females like myself--some of whom were undergraduates. There was a rumor that he had even slept with one of the undergraduates. Once I heard this, I became outraged and decided to tell one of my professors."male,NotAvailable,R2,"My very first true creative writing mentor as an undergrad--I thought the promise of my work made him interested in me.For 1.5/2 yrs I believed I was being guided, assisted, promoted based on talent and effort. Truly, I dont believe I was submitting poor material, but all of it was called into question when I was asked out for drinks alone. Went. And began to sense in tone, comments, intensity that this was not an academic/purely intellectual meeting. I had experienced a very deep, abrupt, and disruptive loss in my family and consolation took a strange turn. Very soon the conversation turned to a romantically slanted one, whereby I made excuses and left. Profoundly disappointed. Every gesture, any 'standing too close' any compliment to my work.. all changed tone. All the ""support"" changed tone. When I discussed it with a graduate 'peer' I was met with, ""what did you expect? You're pretty."" I felt lost. What a strange thing to have to view ones physical self as an intellectual impediment. And then there was the worse, should I?"NotAvailable,NotAvailable,"More Than One Institution (feel free to elaborate in ""Comments"")","Both of my PhD supervisors were serial harassers of female students. They were particularly aggressive toward the cohorts of young master_验s students who cycled through the department each year and therefore were most likely to (a.) not be aware of previous histories, and (b.) try to simply tolerate or avoid the harassment as best as they could because they knew they would only be in the department for the one-year program (although I have little doubt these experiences in some cases terminated thoughts some of them might have had of continuing for a PhD in my department). As a male student who witnessed some incidents and had others confided to me, not all of these stories are mine to tell. However, I will say that none of this behavior was remotely secret. My advisors boasted openly about their constant pursuit of students and deliberately spread rumors about students they wanted to sleep with, were sleeping with, or had been unable to sleep with (the latter category of course being on the receiving end of some of the worst rumors). They also boasted about having helped particularly fabulous looking students gain admission to the department, presumably meaning that students merely gifted with brains rather than with my advisors_验 standards of youth and beauty would not have received such preferential treatment. And of course since physical appearance and perceived pliability were the only attributes my advisors valued in women, they were loud and noxious misogynists when it came to speaking about the intellectual capabilities of female scholars. No matter what superficially charming fa_ade they might occasionally put on in mixed company, when they were among fellow white males (naturally they were bigots, too), any female scholar was deemed simply incapable, weak-minded, and unfit, regardless of whether she were a student or a Max Planck Institute director. It was this level of presumption that all males must feel the same way and so there was no need to hide their behavior or beliefs among comrades that was probably a factor in the viciousness against me after I spoke up. They simply could not believe that a fellow male would be so traitorous as to object to their actions _研 after all, they had never harassed me personally _研 never mind that someone would be insane enough to act in a way so obviously and terminally detrimental to my own career prospects in academia.Apart from what I witnessed in my own department, I_验ll just add a short note regarding my experiences in a non-academic career track after I finished my PhD. I am not an especially gregarious individual, and yet the number of times I have had professional women outside the academy confide to me their assault experiences during graduate study is both stunning and more than a little horrifying in view of how much of an undercount it must represent compared to the number of women who were understandably never inclined to share some of their worst life experiences with a random male colleague. It must therefore always, ALWAYS be remembered that any sampling of sexual harassment and assault experiences within the academy is necessarily going to underestimate the scale of the problem because it will invariably under-sample women who left academia in part or entirely because of harassment."male,NotAvailable,Regional Teaching College,"I was repeatedly sexually assaulted by one of my male professors, while I was his student, when I was an undergraduate.

There was a lab get together where we were at a bar for happy hour. He ran into some friends who were leaving the country the next day and he suggested, in front of the group, that I sleep with his friend as a goodbye gift. When I uncomfortably said ""no"", he started to laugh with his friends that I was uptight and I need to relax.

Another faculty member, also no longer with the department, was the subject of numerous sexual harassment complaints. But, somehow worse, is the male professor who still holds a treasured post there and who, despite his plummy tones, is a deep-seated misogynist. He constantly undermines female graduate students (myself and others), tells them that women need easier treatment because they can't handle serious work, and accuses them of being hysterical/mentally unstable/sensitive.

He wanted to book one room, but I felt very uncomfortable. This made him very angry - because there were budget restrictions. Instead he invited another female student to stay with him, she accepted. When we got back from the conference there was a shift in the dynamic that was I was too naive to understand. Effectively this PhD student was allowed to bully me and slowly their influence over the lab grew. My ideas were taken away from me, and given to other students. I was laughed at in lab meetings and my work was largely ignored. In 2008, I took a research internship at Harvard University (I applied largely to get away from my own lab) but this must have elicited some jealousy because the day after this internship was confirmed, I was suddenly accused of data falsification by my advisor. He didn't approach me, he went straight to the dean of Research. My PhD was put on hold while I underwent a 10 month investigation. There was no basis to his claim, and afterwards I was fully exonerated. Turns out the university was also investigating my advisor at the same time for a potential affair with his other student. When the university questioned him - he initially lied, to keep her as a student. But half way through the investigation into the veracity of my work, he left his wife and proposed to his other PhD student. They married later that year. While under investigation he took it upon himself to tell everyone at my university that I had falsified data. To this day I think my reputation in my home country is questioned. When I finally wrote a formal complaint about the way I was treated during my PhD, my university discovered that he had ""unofficially"" been strongly advised to leave his previous position (as an assistant professor at another university) because he had a reputation for sleeping with his students and had subsequently accused 2 of them of falsification. My university also strong armed him into leaving but he works at another university now.

I am a curvy girl and I made sure I was dressed appropriately."male,social&humanities,Elite Institution/Ivy League,"As the first and only tenure-track faculty of color to be hired by my ex-department, I experienced racism, sexism and prejudice based on national origin for eight years. In particular, from September 2014 onwards, the former chair, a popular and influential personality on campus, engaged habitually in inappropriate, predatory and disrespectful conduct. During this time, I received numerous emails (even during my summer breaks in India), text messages and voice mails asking me to join him for either lunch, coffee or go kayaking with him. Once he had unexpectedly entered my lecture room, minutes before class was to begin, and asked me out for drinks; another time he wanted to go grocery shopping for me. Over the years, I endured his 'bad behavior' that included being intimidated by him twice on the road to work, and being pointedly informed by him that his brother was a parole officer. He also delayed the publication of my monograph, contracted with one of the leading international publishers in my field. The times we did go for lunch, they felt like dates more than meetings. He would also make flirty, suggestive comments; stare at certain parts of my body; and manspread in his office."male,social&humanities,Elite Institution/Ivy League,"I have three instances to report. I was a clinical social worker in health care at a top university in Canada. I did individual, partner , family and group counselling. I was considered a leader in my field of end of life care. The first incident was with a surgeon I worked with. After 2 years of powerful work with clients and their families, my colleague, a married man with several adult children, asked me to meet him for lunch and said he would ""no longer take no for an answer"". He had never asked me for lunch before nor been anything but professional in his behaviour. That should have been my first clue that he felt I was part of his secret life. We went to lunch and I have to say my concern was for his health and well being. I thought he was struggling with something and needed a compassionate ear. At lunch he proposed to me that he buy me : a hospice building and licensing so we could continue to do this work of end of life care. He also offered to pay all the hospice expenses, buy me a condo , a car, and anything else I needed. I was shocked. I asked what he would expect in return for all this generosity and he said :""only that you make yourself available 24/7 to speak to me"". I had been a model in my younger years and was quite familiar with the world of what men and women can get themselves into without occupational boundaries. I was single at the time, having left my husband. I said : ""what if I am with someone and you call to talk"". He said :""you will ask them to leave"". I told him that I was flattered by his wish to access my mind at such an expense to him but that even though he was offering me everything I needed, I was a woman who needed her own independence and so could not agree to this. He then refused to work with me, went to the organizations CEO and tried to discredit me. I was taken off this cancer service and placed in another service , less enjoyable to me. I felt threatened and at risk. I was told by my supervisor to stay in my office and become the best clinician I could become. Security was notified. The surgeon then began an anonymous letter campaign to threaten the surgeon who headed the service i worked on. The surgeon who began this was eventually let go but I had experienced violence and intimidation and coercion in the workplace. I was strong enough to say no but suffered occupational harassment, personal threat, sidetracking of my career and I felt a sense of public shaming by his rife comments when I passed him in the hall.The second incident was a senior neurologist at the university I worked at. He was seeing me as my physician in a dr-patient relationship. I saw him over years. I choose to switch my care from him to another physician when he began to make suggestions that I was sexualizing the relationship ( I have severe pain from a motor vehicle accident and was seeking his opinion on this. it is hard to sexualize anything when you have that level of pain). I was shocked by this, and simply left after an incident where I felt he had said something to his secretary about me that was sexualizing of me as patient. Some ten years later, after I left, he was brought up on charges of sexual harrassment by another client, and these charges resulted in his being fined and having him retire. I think I was witness to this old man loosing his filters....and it went on for some time before someone else called him on it.The third incident is another misuse of power by men. My medical director in end of life care wanted me to support his efforts to bring in a change in policy at a federal level for end of life care. I beleive in the right to your own ideas and freedom of speech in my academic world. I told him I could not support him. I was then head hunted to an international agency in oncology and palliative care in Europe. It was a think tank for cancer care. Upon my return from meeting with the UN about pain managment being a human right, and meeting with this think tank in Switzerland, my elite program on family care was collapsed by this physician-because I would not do as he asked. My program was income generating and a top clinical program. He was trying to silence my voice as its leadership was well recognized. He was a physician and a medical director. I was a director of a psycho-social-spiritual team or family therapy team. We were both top notch players-but I had the international reputation more than he did. He collapsed my program, fired my team, kept on those he could control , hired some of my students who would end up leaving for the same reason I did ( his determining of their practice). What was most interesting was that he asked me to write a paper for publication. I did and heard nothing back. I then asked about it and he said he had lost the paper. 10 years after I wrote that paper, 5 years after I left him employment, one of my medical students ( graduate level) found a published curriculum which gave me second authorship. The first authorship was his. He had taken my paper and published it under his name. I would never have found it unless my student brought it to my attention. All three men, tried to cull my career and use/misuse my presence and abilities.

We downloaded an app to record phone calls too. She did not want to bring attention. Maybe Asian culture but threatened to go to title IX office of she did not report it. She hated me for that.

I married and transferred to a smaller, more (physically) manageable campus to finish my degree. About a year into my marriage, I was a full time student working two jobs and supporting a husband who had quit his job, who told me he did not support my goal of graduate school. I opted out of that situation for my own good, but did not have family support. I sought advice / legal referral from an undergrad professor. He offered me a paid position in the writing center (my third job) which helped me with expenses. During that time, I was propositioned repeatedly by this professor, who clearly knew I was in a vulnerable spot. Later I heard of his proclivity for dating students. I was uncomfortable asking him for a recommendation letter for graduate school, so ended up taking an additional course, post-graduation, with a different professor to get the third recommendation. Five years later, while in graduate school in a different state, I heard from another student the rumor that everyone _岩knew_ I had dated this professor. Fast forward twenty years, that rumor is alive and well in this small town. From what I can piece together, it likely originates from this professor. He is tenured and still teaching.

This pales in comparison to what happened with this same supervisor (also her supervisor), to my good friend ""L"": he asked about her status, she ignored it. Conversation changed to how to pay bills... she said she worked in a bar to pay the bills, he hit on her, said something along the lines of 'women like you' and asked her about going to conferences because 'he and his wife had a deal that whatever happens at conferences stays at conferences'. He also normalized student-prof sexual affairs by saying 'he'd done it before'.

He said he'd be available to answer more of my questions and invited me to meet him for a drink later (which I perceived as a great honor!). Since the conference was taking place at a hotel, I later met him on the main floor in the restaurant. After shaking his hand he invited me up to his room to talk (which I thought was really strange) and I declined, saying that the restaurant was fine. He resisted saying ""oh it's so loud down here"" (It wasn't), and again, I said I preferred to stay there. He looked disgruntled and said OK and we sat down.

We get into his room, and I sat right down in a chair next to the window. He sat across from me. He then said ""This is better. Now, tell me about your childhood"" (Why he asked that...I'm not sure). So I started telling him my history of diagnosis, etc... and then he asked to take my pulse. I gave him my wrist and he held it, starting to run his fingers on my skin. I jolted my arm back, stated ""I need to go"", got up, and walked to the door. He started saying ""What...why are you leaving? Don't you want to stay""? I opened the door to leave, and he said ""Well at least give me a hug"". When he hugged me he started kissing my neck. I ran into the hallway and straight to the elevator, and started frantically pressing the button....wishing the elevator would hurry up. I felt like prey. I got into the elevator completely shaking."male,social&humanities,Other Type of School,"A male colleague, another graduate student in my department, had apparently been talking to others in the department about his fantasies concerning me and his girlfriend. I am gay and was open about it. On a class field trip that required a stay of several nights in a hotel he was put in charge of making hotel reservations. He attempted to manipulate the hotel rooms so that it would put me in the same room as his girlfriend where I guess he thought we would inevitably act out his fantasies. No one told me about any of this until we were in the airport about to leave for the trip. His girlfriend ultimately did not come on the trip because he assaulted her and her advisor pulled her out of the trip. The previous year he had assaulted another grad student he was dating. He had also followed another female graduate student around a party trying to show her his penis.A few minor incidents - being warned away from working with a certain professor at another university because of his behavior with younger women. Numerous rumors, or more like open secrets, about important professors and directors of institutions and their younger female students.

I had no experience with this whatsoever and very little time in which to write the code, but my supervisor insisted that it had to be done this way (I was hoping to have him as my advisor for the PhD program the following year so I wanted to impress him). I was approached by a PhD student who had offered to help me write the code, in exchange for authorship on a future paper that would arise from the project. I agreed, and we also negotiated payment from my supervisor to write the code. It started out well, with the student assuring me that he could write the code in one week. However, he then began requesting that I sit with him whilst he put the code together. I desperately needed the code so I could conduct my research work (which formed my dissertation project for the year), so I would come in and sit with him (sometimes this would be in the middle of the night as he said he could only code then). During this time, he would make lots of sexually explicit comments about me, which I laughed off and ignored in the hopes that he would finish the coding. He would then guilt me into going for drinks with him at the end of the day, and threaten to stop writing the code unless I went with him. I went along with this, trying to act professionally in the hopes that he would just do the work. This ended up going on for the best part of 2 months, which was absolutely emotionally exhausting. Eventually, I had enough of his behaviour and began to hint at him that I was in a relationship in the hopes that the inappropriate comments would stop. This led to him berating me for ""leading him on"" and suggested that I let everyone know about my relationship status when I first meet them so that I don't confuse people in the future. He then started to belittle me in the lab in front of other (male) researchers and suggested that I was too emotional to be a scientist/shouldn't bother because as a female I would never be as good as my male colleagues. He then continued to harass me for about 6 months, showing up randomly at my house/my office/events I was attending. Eventually I had to finish writing my thesis at home to avoid him. My colleagues suggested that I should make a formal complaint against the student, but as a masters student I didn't feel like I had the authority to make such a complaint and was worried about how it would make me look. So I didn't say anything. "male,NotAvailable,Elite Institution/Ivy League,"As a freshman English major, I received the opportunity to work as an intern with a non-profit organization.

I was admitted to a highly regarded PHD program in my field straight out of college in my early 20s. At the time, I was admittedly quite naive and more than a little pollyannaish about the world (and academia in particular). My first semester, I befriended a fellow grad student in a class we both took. We shared similar academic interests and even though he was quite a bit older than most of the rest of the students (he had already been active in the industry/business side of the field for years) he seemed cool. We connected on social media and messaged back-and-forth a bit, including after the class had ended. Apparently, he interpreted what I thought were just friendly chats as something more, and proceeded to use that forum to hit on me, ask me out, and then would not take no for an answer until I finally laid down a pretty severe boundary. Keep in mind that although technically a colleague, he was still 15-20 years my senior, and already an active professional in the field.

At the end of our pre-meeting, he asked if he could answer a question. When I said he could, he proceeded to ask me about my sex life.

He ignored me, except when he turned to me to complain that the course was going downhill because ""nowadays there have to be black lesbians on every syllabus"" because of political correctness. This course had no black lesbians on the syllabus (in fact, no women writers at all, and hardly any modern texts). I am a white, straight, middle-class woman and was surprised at this remark.

Until he suddenly focused on me, exclaiming: ""what am I thinking, we have a woman with us today. We should talk about Helen of Troy and her sexuality!"" I wasn't sure how to respond, but it was clear he wanted me to talk about sexuality in some form, which I didn't.

I matriculated in the Fall of that year. I had previously completed a Masters degree in American history, the field I intended to pursue with [Removed], who would have been my advisor. Within the first few months of working together, it became apparent that Professor [Removed] was not comfortable with my research topic, or with me. I have epilepsy, which has primarily presented as petit mal seizures and is controlled by medication. The first indication I had that my working relationship with Professor [Removed] was not going well occurred in a phone conversation. She told me that I should jettison my M.A. thesis for a side project that I had created in matter of weeks. She became irritated when, confused, I asked a number of questions. _岩If you want to bring sexual violence back in,_ she said, _岩do that. People write about it because it_验s trendy._ I was horrified. After a long silence, she said, _岩You know I am joking._ _岩Yes_ I said, _岩I know you are joking,_ not really able to understand the exchange we were having. A few weeks later, I told her I needed to talk about doing primary source research in Georgia. I had, in essence, written two MA theses, one of which I had graduated with, and the other I offered as my admissions essay. Since Professor X did not approve of my research on sexual violence, I tried to bring our attention to my work on local courts in Western Georgia. If this work was to be the focus of my dissertation, however, I was going to need on-site access to court records. I would need to drive. Even if, in the course of our work together, we decided a working with a more centralized archive was preferable, I needed her to make an informed decision. So I told Professor X of my condition, and informed her that I cannot drive. I asked her advice, strictly in regard to research. She was hostile. She would not have a conversation, and repeatedly suggested that in fact, I could drive. It was not until at least three meeting later that I flatly told her _岩driving is off the table, it will not happen._ She told me that she had _岩grown up poor,_ that no one had believed in her, and that I should therefore find a way to make my situation work. I reiterated that I could not, in fact, drive, that it is illegal for me to drive, and that I wanted nothing from her except advice on how to successfully research in my particular situation. As is procedure, I spoke with our Director of Graduate Studies (DGS), who largely belittled me.In the spring, I was assigned (by the same DGS) to work as T.A. for a known harasser, [Removed]. This man sat next to me and sang songs about fraternity brothers impregnating sorority girls. He joked about an actress who was in a car accident, making comments about her breasts. On my first day in his class, when I (and my fellow T.A.) sat down, he said to the class _岩they sure look interesting, don_验t they? But we will find out if they are. We will find out if they have anything to say._ He let (mostly male) students question my grades and my authority in the classroom to the point that I really was nothing more than his secretary. I complained, repeatedly. He was considered immovable.I went through much of that first year in Grad school essentially without an advisor. I should note that, while students often do not formally declare an advisor until their second year, most do have informal relationships with Professors, and all receive the benefit of some kind of mentorship. I went without this for nearly all of my first year. Midway through the second semester of my first year, I took a course with Professor Y [Removed], who agreed to become my advisor. This move entailed, however, a radical shift in focus, and with that, a huge amount of work. I changed my field from American history to European, and with the help of Professor Y, formulated a new research topic, specializing in 18th century France and the history of emotions. It began to look as though I was through the worst. Professor Y and I started to pull together a dissertation committee. My grades were flawless. I was genuinely interested in my new field. I missed my old work, and was still hurt and confused by Professor X's behaviour, but I wanted to move forward. Professor Y suggested that I enroll in Professor Z's seminar, and ask him to serve on my committee. I did. This was a terrible mistake. After about four class sessions, Professor Z expelled me from his class. I was the only woman in the class. He sent everyone out of the room except me, came back in, and began an argument with me, much of which, unfortunately, I don_验t remember. I do know that he told me _岩You don_验t need to be here_ and told me that he would withdraw me from his course. He also told me he would not be on my committee, a statement, that, while it seems obvious enough, is, in the context of a small department, intended to convey that he will be do his part to see that I do not progress toward graduation. The only explanations he offered were 1) that I typed too loudly and 2) I had paused too long before answering a question. I believe that my disclosure to Professor X influenced Professor Z_验s behavior. Even if evidence of this is lacking, the fact that, by this point, most of the department was aware of my health status made it nearly impossible for me to complain about what was happening. I was a pariah.I assumed, however, that the department would, at the very least, form a committee to investigate, or perhaps offer mediation. There was nothing. This is still the worst part of this situation to me. Absolutely no one, apart from my own advisor, cared about this in the least. It was a career-breaking move, and it was meant to be. The following fall, I enrolled in a required pedagogy course and (also required) methods course. Though I did well in both of these courses, I had to work harder than my peers, and was the subject of a good deal of mockery in my methods course. This was a direct result of the fact that 1) I had to change focus in yr. 1 and 2) I had been withdrawn from a course in yr. 2 and therefore been deprived of a research/writing opportunity. Therefore, in year 3, when I took our required grant writing/ portfolio preparation course, I was lagging behind my peers. The complaint here is that the department knew what had happened, knew they had not addressed it, knew that it was quantifiably slowing my progress to degree, and, nevertheless, placed the burden on me. They did this not only in the sense that they refused to change deadlines, there were also numerous subtle barbs in the classroom. For instance, when I offered my proposal for workshop, the professor, Prof Q, mocked the use of French text, saying _岩Now you are just showing off_ and encouraged other students to do the same. Perhaps it does not need to be said, but the dissertation is about France. This is common practice. The underlying assertion of Professor Q's statement is that I am too stupid to be doing the work I am doing, and something is out of joint.Finally, I was pressured out because 1) it became clear that there would be no relenting on the timeline _研 it would remain the same, despite the fact that others had made mistakes, not me, and despite the fact that those errors had never been internally adjudicated. I was essentially forced to take a semester leave, because without it, I could not have passed Professor Q_验s methods course. The reason I could not have passed it was that I needed a (pre-existing) research paper in order to do so. My peers didn_验t have this problem, but Professor Z had thrown me out the course where I would have written this paper. So, in order to avoid an F on my record, I gave up a semester worth of funding. 2) My advisor let me know that the department had little to no intention of funding me any longer than they were contractually obligated to. That time was coming soon. He said, and I believed, that my work was very good, and could be funded. There is limited funding for French historians, however, and it is even more limited for those historians in the early stages of their careers. My choices were: a) fund myself for a while until that eventuality, and then let Duke take credit for my work or b) save the money and emotional effort. I chose b, but it cost me a lot of pain."male,applied&formal,Other Type of School,"I worked for my undergrad advisor in the lab and at a remote field camp. While I was his student and after I graduated as his technician, he would do inappropriate things that I imagine were intended as flirting (once he put my sweaty field shirt on his head, huffed it, and said in a suggestive way that it smelled like me), send inappropriate emails (for example, he sent me a picture of a penis, though not his own as far as I know), say inappropriate things (once he said that if I wanted help with something then I should come by his office in a dress and makeup and try asking him for whatever it was), and occasionally tried inappropriate things like reaching across the breakfast table to put his hands on mine. He offered to help me publish research papers - he explained that this was the missing piece to my being a very strong grad applicant. He was the first academic to show interest in helping me build my career. I had a long term partner and felt that since I set strong, clear boundaries, I could handle his odd behavior. After I graduated, I worked for a grad student in the same department but a different lab. My grandfather got ill, and I left that field job early to come home. The grad student for whom I was working did not take the news well and was upset that I was leaving the project early. When the professor found out, he threatened to ruin my career. Despite this man's odd behavior, I had considered him a friend and mentor, and I was really upset that he completely turned on me.

Some time later he found out that she told me and got nasty towards both of us. I reported him to the department, but the adviser didn't take me seriously and encouraged all of us to sit down to talk it out as she thought it was just a misunderstanding. When he found out I had reported him, he told the department adviser that he wanted to shut me up and that if this continued he'd ruin mine and my friend's career by going to our adviser. I asked for and was granted a university restraining order against him, to which he responded by getting a restraining order against me, claiming that I was out to get him. Though the restraining order prohibits discussing circumstances with other members of the university who are not involved, he told my entire lab group some story about how I was a crazy person and making up stories to get him kicked out. I only found out when one of my labmates stopped speaking to me and told me I should have kept my mouth shut. I alerted the Title IX office as well as a university office that he was violating his terms of the order and retaliating against me for coming forward. University office didn't do anything. Title IX had a very intimidating and aggressive interview process for both me and my friend, who was scared about coming forward in the first place. Title IX concluded that they thought he was crazy but that he wasn't going to do anything and was going to be out of the country for the next couple of months. No action taken.

This was someone I didn't know personally and didn't see outside of class. He later started following me on campus and entering into coffee shops and pubs that I was in with friends to watch me. One night after I had a few pints he approached me at the pub when friends were leaving and tried to walk me home. I, fortunately, was escorted home by my friends.

She isolated me from colleagues, spreading rumors about me, and threatening to withdraw her support in an increasingly difficult department if I didn't give her the time and attention she wanted. Finally she lured me into a meeting in her car, where she sexually assaulted me. I refused to let her into my office after that, and so she retaliated by stalking and harassing me at home late at night, threatening my wife and friends. When I called 911 they said that they couldn't come out if there wasn't an active threat (phone calls and text messages weren't enough). I reported to title IX who negotiated an agreement between us. She now regularly retaliates against my graduate students by refusing them normal assistance that other faculty members give to students. She has stuck to the letter of the negotiated agreement, though, and so I don't feel like I can ask for more help navigating this.

He gave me smothering hugs and would not leave me alone, he kissed me on the cheek, at which point I demanded some distance."male,natural,Other R1,"In 2012 I was a postdoc and attended a national conference out of state. On the last day of the conference, at the conference dinner, I sat at a table of people I did not previously know. During dinner, I spoke at length with the man sitting next to me, who worked in a different area than I and who was at mid-career academic status. We talked about our research, our universities (we worked in the same state in different cities), and our families. As I often do, I mentioned my husband multiple times throughout our conversation-- partly because I like talking about him and I'm very proud of what he does but also to make it clear that I was married and not interested in talking to this person for any other reason than professional interest. This man also talked about his wife and family. I had no reason to suspect that our conversation was perceived by him as anything other than professional. After dinner, some colleagues that I knew were moving on with a group to a nearby bar, and this man I had been speaking with at dinner joined us to walk over. When we got to the bar, people ordered drinks then sat down at tables-- this man came and sat next to me, and many other colleagues were sat around the table. Shortly after we sat down, he discreetly moved his hand back to my rear end and began jamming his thumb between my buttocks. I was startled and jumped slightly, shocked that this was happening at all, especially in a crowded table full of academics. I reached my hand down and forcefully pushed his hand away. He then turned to me and said ""are you going to stay here"", and I said ""yes, I am"". He looked disappointed. He again touched my rear end and jammed his thumb between my buttocks. Again I pushed it away forcefully. At this stage he got up from the table. I was terrified and wanted to leave, but it would have meant walking back to my nearby hotel, and I was scared that he would follow me to my hotel. I looked around and realized that all of the colleagues in the room whom I knew well were male, and I didn't want to ask one of them to walk with me back to the hotel because I thought that would sound weird. I didn't feel I knew any of them well enough to tell them what had happened. I was scared. I leaned over to the woman (whom I did not know) across from me at the table and began engaging her in conversation about her research, hoping that the man had left, and I could wait a while then walk back to my hotel. Unfortunately, he came back with another drink and sat next to me. He discreetly tried to touch me on my rear end and jam his thumb up me a few more times. I pushed his hand away and kept talking to the woman across from me, trying not to pay him any attention. He got up and went to the bathroom, then came back, sat down one more time, and asked me again if I was going to stay there or if I wanted to leave. I said I was going to stay there. He looked visibly annoyed, and after another minute or so, got up, announced he was leaving, and walked out. My heart was racing. I still didn't want to leave on my own in case he was hanging around outside the bar. So I decided I would stay there and wait until some of the group that I knew headed back to the hotel where we were staying. I continued to try to engage in conversation with the people around me, but I was almost shaking with fear. I had never been assaulted like this before, and I was in shock that someone had tried to do this in a professional setting, in a crowded room full of colleagues. Eventually, people started to leave, and I walked back to my hotel with two male colleagues that I knew well, quickly locking myself into my hotel room to break down and cry. My flight was the next day, and I stayed in my hotel room until the last possible moment I needed to leave to go to the airport, terrified that I might see this man again. Once I was home, I broke down, hysterically crying, and explained to my husband what had happened. I felt so unsafe, so violated, and so discouraged for a long time. I purposefully avoided the city where the event took place for the next two years, avoiding going to any conferences or seminars there. The man didn't even live in that city or state, but I was traumatized by what had happened there. I received an email from the man about a week after the incident, sent to my institutional email address. He said that he had had too much to drink and he apologized for anything inappropriate that he said or did. I was disgusted even seeing an email from him, and immediately deleted it. I never told any of my academic colleagues about the incident. I was scared at the time that accusations might be made that it was inappropriate for us to be in a bar drinking, even though it was a group situation and I had started out the evening thinking everything was professional and above board. I didn't know what to do. I was scared people would not believe me or take me seriously. Also, he was at a different university, and the incident had occurred at an out of town conference. Even if I had wanted to report the incident, I didn't know if I should talk to my university, his, or the conference organization where the incident had taken place. About a year later, I did a university survey on bullying and sexual harassment in the workplace. I responded that yes, I had been sexually harassed, but I did not give any further details. The university did not follow up with me on my response. This is the first time I've recounted what happened at length. My heart is racing even now, 5 years later, as I write about it. I have never felt such helplessness as I did that night. And it has changed the way I interact with colleagues at academic conferences and in my academic workplace. I am wary of everyone, and I put up a wall so that conversations don't get too in depth about anything. That's a shame, because I'm probably missing out on some great opportunities to connect with new colleagues. It gets better with time, though, and I am slowly learning to trust again that I can have a professional conversation in a professional setting with a man in my profession without the possibility of being sexually assaulted.

Traditionally, upon graduation, the student_验s thesis advisor will introduce the defending student prior to the research talk. I recently witnessed a graduating female student be introduced by her thesis advisor in the most inappropriate way. To provide a bit of background, a common technique in the field and that is commonly used in this particular lab is the use of light suction, typically applied by mouth into a pipette, to open and record currents in brain cells. His whole introduction of her revolved around how he knew she would be successful in his lab because she had an oral obsession. The slide he showed actually had a title along the lines of _岩orally obsessed_ and showed photos of the student making sour expressions and playing a wind instrument. The entire room was detectably uncomfortable, people were visibly squirming in their chairs, uncomfortably laughing, and looking away. The student ignored the introduction and gave one of the most thoughtful and comprehensive talks I have ever attended, which was her only option given that looking visibly shaken would have thrown her off balance. It is unfortunate, though, that the expectation was for her to remain poised and unmoved despite the clearly sexist introduction. What was most saddening was the fact that this person, who has just earned a doctoral degree in a STEM field, had her family, friends, and colleagues there to celebrate her PROFESSIONAL merits and her advisor introduces her in a sexist and deeply unprofessional way. After that I only spoke about the incident with female colleagues and classmates, but I wish there was a way that this issue could be addressed at an institutional level, with this type of behavior set as an example of what not to do. This is a tenured professor that is close to retirement, so people shrug it off as _岩this is just one person and the problem will disappear when he_验s gone._ But this is an institutional problem and many men in positions of power think that as long as they are not raping someone, they are falling in line with the rules of professionalism.

He was most known for touching women without consent at the bar where he held his ""office hours"" and at department parties. The culture of the faculty and students in the associated departments revolved around whispering about the powerful professor's alleged actions. His reputation appeared to be decades in the making, and perhaps followed him from his previous teaching institutions. Though there are surely dozens of undisclosed cases that involve this individual, I am able to speak to two specific events that involved friends (fellow graduate students) and faculty members who are primary sources. In January of 2014, this individual molested two of of his graduate students at the bar during the first week of their second semesters in their graduate program. In both assaults, which occurred within an hour of each other and in public but hidden from view, he forced his hand into their pants and underwear, and in one instance repeatedly tried to grab the student's , When the incident was divulged to a senior faculty member and acting dean of students, a secret meeting was held with both of the students, the abusive faculty member, and the senior faculty, who proceeded to make list of rules that the abuser must follow as a resolution to the issue. The entire issue was swept under the rug and the abusive professor continued to teach for another year, advised students, sat on committees, and though his list of rules stipulated that office hours at the bar were no longer permitted, the abusive faculty member was unfazed and continued to regularly convene with students there. My friends, desperate to find justice, were advised to wait until they had solidified their degrees before reporting the incidents to the university. Neither of them shared any information about the abuse until Fall semester 2015, when one of them broke down after finding out that the abusive faculty member had When their degrees were signed in 2015 (one had to have her abuser's signature in order to graduate), they reported using proper channels. The HR representatives seemed as though they had been waiting for their statements, which led me to believe that they had been investigating the matter previously. After long and arduous plans were made by HR to file a university lawsuit against the professor using the accusations of my friends as a basis, the abusive professor was somehow allowed to disappear under the excuse of ""retirement"". He vanished from the department without a trace after decades of teaching and extreme influence. The case was dropped. No statements were made in regards to his sudden absence, though terrible misogynist rumors spread like wild fire amongst the departments, and his those who protected him before his removal became more adamant in their refusal to hear or admit to his indiscretions. I attended the initial HR meeting as a supportive shoulder for my friends, and my active participation in care, coupled with my vocal dissent of the abuser to other graduate students, landed me on a blacklist for my final year of my graduate program. Faculty members made evident their allegiances by committing conspiracy of secrecy after the abuser was ""vanished"" from the university. The majority of those who belonged to his camp- faculty who had once been friendly, cordial and actively engaged in my studies, including the chair of my committee, stopped speaking to me and refused to look me in the eye. During this period of growing disillusionment (with nearly every faculty member that I had worked with during my graduate career), I attended a spring semester (2016) gathering at the home of the then-Director of Graduate studies for the affiliate department in which I was a student. While casually discussing interdepartmental politics, the subject of sexual harassment and the unexplained absence of the abusive professor was broached by the DGS. As I began to openly and explicitly explain the details of the January 2014 bar incident (the students involved had asked for the story to be discussed factually and publicly at the time), the DGS looked startled. She spoke in a hushed tone to myself and three other students, admitting that the abusive professor in question had molested her in exactly the same fashion (groping her vagina) during a faculty party when she first started teaching at the University in 2009. Her take away had been to diminish the action as negligible, detaching herself entirely, and continued to assert that instances of harassment or abuse would not be something that she would not let affect her career or her reputation. . I begged her to see why her non-action had led to years of continued abusive behavior, and specifically asked, ""If you had wanted to help a student in this situation, what would you do?"" Her response indicated that she seemed to find my concern for the wellbeing of students to be naive and overly sensitive. Though the specific incident of student abuse occurred almost four years ago, and the complaints/reports were made during 2014-2015, and the professor has been ""retired"" for a year of time, there has not been any kind form of formal or informal public address from the department, university, or community members regarding this situation. It seems as though too many people are implicated in the web of lies and feigning ignorance, and if one were to speak, all of those who protected the abuser would be outed."male,social&humanities,Elite Institution/Ivy League,"A series of events in which no particular event stands out as definitely crossing the line, but that when experienced together over time was extremely uncomfortable and confusing. I was an undergraduate and he was my professor, major advisor, honors thesis advisor, and one of my letter writers for my graduate school applications--so he had a ton of power and influence over me. It started when I was working with him on some research over the summer. Since it was summer, we met more often than we would have during the school year and the office where his building was located was even more deserted than normal. When we would meet, he would often sit next to me on the same side of the table rather than across the table or perpendicular to me. The door to his office was often closed. He sometimes offered me a coat or blanket to cover me up. This made me feel very uncomfortable because I was afraid he would try to touch me underneath the blanket. He once touched the hair on the back of my head when he was sitting next to me. He pressured me into going out to coffee or dinner with him three times that I can remember. On one occasion in particular he talked to me about how he had a crush on a professor when he was in undergrad. I don't remember the details, but that was described as a very positive experience and it very much felt like he was trying to draw a parallel between that relationship and ours. He often talked about his children but he never talked about his wife to the point that I remember thinking he must have been divorced. He was not. He once told me something like it's okay if other people thought he and I were dating because we had gone out to coffee and dinner. He pressured me into letting him visit me in my hometown. He did come to my house, but thankfully my parents were home. The rest of the visit was in public places. I remember hoping that this visit would be quick and painless but it ended up that he stayed for several hours. One day I finally got up the courage to stand up to him. I think I said something like I haven't always felt comfortable around you or something. I don't remember his exact response, but he kind of shrugged it off, like I'm sorry you feel that way or something like that."male,social&humanities,Other R1,"Fall 2015, I started my PhD in a new program in the same college where I need received my masters. I was at an orientation get-together for new and current grad students at a local restaurant/bar. Only one prof showed up, but he was drunk, high, and disheveled when he showed up. I thought he was another grad student. I didn't chat much with him because I felt his presence, especially in the inebriated condition he was in, was inappropriate. It wasn't long before he made small talk, we discussed the upcoming semester, he assumed I was taking his philosophy course, but I hadn't told him I wasn't because I'd already had philosophy in my masters program. He asked how I felt about the program and I told him I thought I'd have a good time. He smirked, grabbed his beer, chuckled a bit, and said ""I'll make sure of it"" as he took a sip. I was so shocked, I sat there for 5 minutes trying to decide if I heard him correctly. My 14yo daughter was there so I got up and we left. The professor said ""see you in class"" and I told him I wouldn't be there. He was shocked and we left. I come from tech and am used to off-color comments, but for some reason, this threw me. After a few days I started taking to folks. One, a grad student who was friends with the prof tried to blow it off, ""he always says that, it is nothing!"" And I kept asking myself, and that student, since when does that excuse the behavior? Another grad student, male, described a situation where in the philosophy class I was not taking, he witnessed the prof being affectionate toward the female grad students, who happened to be primarily Asian. Then the Prof boasted of his sexual conquests with female Asian grad students in the past to my friend while walking to the bar for class (he held class in the local bars all the time). I was going to let his behavior toward me pass, I ended up calling a prof friend in my program and described this whole situation to her. She said they've had suspicion this was happening but no one willing to report it officially. So she suggested I go to the department chair and grad director. I did and they were very supportive and understanding, suggested I go to the Title IX office and file a complaint. It's worth noting that by this time i started feeling depressed.I filed my report and the Title IX office kept losing track of it's progress. Nearly six months later and they finally determined that the words the prof spoke we're harmless, he admitted to speaking them, and there was nothing to address other than to have a talk with him about how his words can be misinterpreted and require mandatory sexual harassment training as part of the grad school orientation program for this college. When the grad director for sat down with me to go over the report, he want nearly as supportive. Quite the opposite. When the topic of the sexual harassment training came up, the way he introduced it to me was ""now, because of you, we had to add an extra hour to the orientation program.""

Eventually, I fell for it and sex happened. I was lost after that, I did not know whom to ask for advice except my harasser, who continued to harass me and driving me into sex. She used everything from blackmail me that she would made it public and I would loose my girlfriend, to shame me for the cheater I was, to make me believe I was the one hurting her by refusing to be with her. In conferences she also suggested me several times to have sex and eventually started spreading the rumours about us.

During this my male supervisor would just sit there. The other man was never asked to stop by anyone other than me. I was never asked to stop standing up for myself, but our mutual supervisor (a campus dean) also never spoke up. In our final encounter, the man asked me to stay after a meeting stating that he had a business related question.

We were hired at the same time. After being pressured, I met him for a bite to eat.

"male,social&humanities,Elite Institution/Ivy League,"In 1979 when I was a sophomore in college a professor invited me to his office hours because I was supposedly struggling in a course. (However, when I would compare my exam and assignment answers to my male peers when we would study together for the next exam or try to figure out the next assignment, I discovered that they earned As and I got Ds or Fs. Our work was nearly identical and the answers the same; this really confused me.). When I arrived in his office he motioned to a couch and asked me to sit down. I thought he would sit in the chair at his desk. He closed the door, locked it, and came and sat beside me. He told me that he knew I was a ""smart girl"" and that I should not be earning a D. He said that I could take care of the grade ""right now"" if I wanted to. I asked if he meant by redoing assignments or retaking exams. He said, ""No, by doing things with me in the office right now. The door is locked and no one will ever know."" I said, ""I don't know what kind of person you think I am, but I'll take the D."" I then immediately went to my major adviser, and told him what happened. I said I wanted to file a complaint. He told me not to do it because I was going to be abroad the entirety of the following year and he was afraid that if I filed a complaint that the school would try to block me from going. He said that I needed to trust him but the situation would be taken care of by the time I got back. He also said that he didn't want to see me get ""blamed"" as a victim or to have my reputation tarnished as I would be dragged through the mud. I was very upset but trusted him. I went abroad. While I was away a friend wrote to me and told me that the professor who had propositioned me had been fired because two female students had brought him up on contributing to the delinquency of a minor and sexual assault charges. I'm thankful for those two women and think of them often. They were brave. I have no idea who they were. Now, I think I was a coward. I also wonder if my major professor did the right thing by advising me not to file a complaint. However, had I not gone abroad I don't think I would have been as well positioned for graduate school, nor would I have had a series of experiences that led me to choose the professoriate as a career. My resentment, however, is that I was many years later told by a professor at my undergraduate institution that the D on my transcript knocked me out of contention for Phi Beta Kappa despite the fact that I had a higher GPA than most of the other students who were inducted during my senior year. He had been a part of the deliberations, which were very contentious and made my case memorable because normally the committee saw eye-to-eye. He was outraged when he learned the reason why I had the D on my transcript. "male,social&humanities,Other R1,"a group of my friends and I were groomed by a professor of ours over a period of about 3 years. He pitted us against each other for his approval and attention, purposefully curtailed our friendships with one another, and eventually went so far as to get hotel rooms at the fanciest hotel in the city and invite a few of us to ""visit"" him, and took one of my fellow students (who was maybe 19 years old at the time?) on vacations to New York City and to Paris. He would invite us over to his home to watch films and drink (most of us were under age at the time) and smoke with him. He did his best to make us feel ""special"" and like ""real artists"" or some shit and then he used that to manipulate us. As I was about to graduate, one day he corned me and forcefully kissed me in front of a few of our friends, who laughed as I pushed him away. He did not try to kiss or touch me afterward, likely because I had humiliated him in front of our mutual friends. However, after that I was more or less ""out"" of our group and he ostracized me."male,social&humanities,Elite Institution/Ivy League,"Another female graduate student and I had drinks at the biggest national conference in our field with 2 esteemed male professors; these men were co-authors of a book with my advisor. They were from different institutions. After drinks we walked and talked, and split up; the older one (who I was with) told me that we should go up to his room and talk. Once there, we kissed. He took his pants off and pushed my head to his penis, and asked me to give him a blow job (which I did.) Then he asked me to leave. I had no intention of doing anything sexual; I idolized him and wanted to talk with him. He used me for an orgasm and threw me away like a kleenex. My self esteem was shaken for years.

(also, my marriage was going downhill at the time, so I was pretty vulnerable) This second reader invited me out for drinks on a weekly basis, began to ""dis"" my primary adviser and my third reader, and shared with me his marital problems and frustrations. I was flattered that he thought ""highly"" enough of me to share these confidences and to be so honest with me - and as a clergy person, I was easily drawn in to his need to disclose and share his ""troubles."" This ultimately led to a sexual relationship while at a conference in England - after my dissertation was turned in, but before my defense. He could have waited to screw me until after the defense - the fact that he didn't demonstrates the power play involved.

We worked closely when I was an undergraduate and he was the Dean of Students, as I was heavily involved in student government. But the harassment didn't really start until after I graduated and I was in grad school and he was no longer in a position of true power over me, at least institutionally. When I was in graduate school in abroad, he came overseas for an ""official visit"" to a study abroad institution his university in the States had a relationship with, but now I'm not sure it was really for official business or just to visit me. We met at a museum but I came down with a headache. He gave me a very strong painkiller and I started to feel sick from the drug. We were staying in the same hotel (when we checked in, he tried to get me to stay in his room, but I insisted on my own room). I ended up falling asleep in my room and when I woke up he was in the bed with me. I asked him to leave and he did without too much protest. Since then, he is very clingy through email and once came to my hometown while I was there to visit my family and got very angry with me when I couldn't make time to see him and wanted to instead spend time with my family. He often emails me angrily when I don't email him for many weeks. When I got my first academic job, he would often write and ask if there ways for me bring him over as a ""consultant"" or a ""guest speaker,"" which I never did, but he would get a little upset with me when I wouldn't respond. He asked me for a letter of recommendation which I wrote, but because I was starting to recognize how his behavior with me over the years was inappropriate, the letter was sort of lukewarm. He wrote an angry email to me demanding that I rewrite the letter. I have since cut off communication with him although he occasionally messages me on LinkedIn.

While the class was still going on, the professor sent me a friend request on FaceBook. I accepted and he started chatting with me online, noting that he liked the same movies and music as I did. One day I was having a rough time with family issues and he started chatting with me online about it, then suggested I come over to his apartment to watch The Princess Bride with him. I went and he kissed me and called me a man-eater. I was surprised and disgusted and I left. That same semester, he had sex with the other student in my class. All of this occurred while he was still our professor and had yet to grade us. Later, I met and spoke to one of his graduate assistants, a young man.

I was not treated equally to the male assistant professors (similar achievements did not ""count"" for as much as me, similar weaknesses were counted more heavily against me).

I had not been saying no the whole time, I was very drunk and I think was just going along with it. However, I think back to how I told him in the beginning of the night that nothing was going to happen.

Whenever I mentioned or made edits related to sex, gender, race, or sexuality, he'd make comments like, ""you and your girl-power thing again"". He often told me I'd grow out of my naivete and idealism when I was older (I was 26). Male employees did not report having to deal with these attitudes. A year into the 2-year position, I came in to his office to find a screenshot of my face, from a music video I'd been in, as his computer background. I had told him I was in the video because it caused me to miss a day of work, and he bragged that he had tracked it down and was surprised how tasteful it was because he ""thought it would be a bunch of half-naked women lounging on car hoods"".

When I made comments during conversations, both one-on-one and in larger groups of physics grad students, he would frequently invalidate me, suggesting that I had seen nothing of the real world, and that I was nothing more than a wealthy sheltered child.

He would drive by my house repeatedly, wait at the end of the bike path where he knew I liked to ride, and occasionally sit on my front steps and wait for me to get home at the end of the day. One day, he chased me out of the gym and screamed at me on the athletic quad. During departmental coffee hours and other social events, he would glare at me, shifting his position to maintain his line of sight. He texted me a death threat, and spread rumors in the department that I cheated on my problem sets and exams. He also circulated the rumor that I was only accepted into the program because of my gender identity, and that I only passed the first year because I am pretty. When I told my close friends about the harassment, many abandoned me, saying that it was my fault for breaking his heart. Since there were virtually no female faculty members in my department, and certainly none with whom I had ever conversed, I went to the administrative coordinator. She put me in touch with the Title IX office. The possible paths forward included an on campus no-contact order (which would not protect me in my off campus residence or neighborhood), or a full on restraining order. The Title IX office suggested that if I feared further retaliation, I should not press charges. I was extremely fearful of retaliation.

(I never discussed it with her). At a national conference university sponsored party, the chair introduced me to to his friend/colleague (notably another department chair at an elite institution), and then the other department chair acted very lewd and disgusting towards me in front of my Dept Chair.

He offered to share his and walk me to his car so he could drive me to mine (the parking lot was large and connected with a nearby mall). Once we left the restaurant into the open night, he forcibly pulled me to his side. It was aggressive. When we reached his car, he forced himself on me. Pulled the back of my head toward him and forcibly kissed me, tongue and all. Later, touched and exposed my breasts even as I told him no.

I wanted to get away, but I was afraid of making him angry. I didn't know what to do. He followed me and sat down next to me and kissed me again, simultaneously grabbing me between the legs and then said ""I can feel how wet you are for me"". I jumped up and demanded he take me back to campus. He was angry and stormed past me. He took me back, and never spoke to me again.

If you don't pass, you basically wash out of the program. As part of the exam, we had to meet periodically throughout the semester with the three members on the exam committee who would evaluate the essay each student eventually produced. The only male professor on the committee was a total creep and a jerk. He spoke to my breasts for the entire conversation every time we met. He would often wander around his office as we talked, pausing mostly behind me to ""look over my shoulder"" and I suspect down my shirt. The whole thing made me feel dirty, but also trapped because I knew this guy had a lot of power regarding whether I continued in the program or not. So I ultimately didn't report anything. What was I going to say anyway? Professor So-and-so looks at me wrong? He left the university for another academic job after that year, and since he's left I've talked to probably six other grad students who had the same experience with him. All he did was stare at your tits. Of course, the male grad students had nothing but great things to say about his insights for their research and his mentorship. They were scholars to him. We (the women) were objects. "male,social&humanities,Other R1,"I didn't consider this a form of harassment exactly at the time, yet my thoughts have returned to it many times in recent weeks; the degree to which we all took it as more or less normal seems to me illustrative of how bad normal has been. A fellow graduate student was working in the department's main research center (a title VI funded area studies center). He was always an arrogant, somewhat unpleasant, self-righteous type (and evangelical Christian no less, relevant because of the hypocrisy). One day the (female) director entered the center, a space always open to the public and students (both undergrad and grad), not at all a private office, and there was the grad student in question, on the clock supposed to be working, but instead masturbating to porn right there at his work computer in a public university office. The box of tissues he was careful to keep by the computer took on a whole new connotation, as did the crusty stains on the chair that other grad students were forced to sit in as well as they worked their shifts in the center. The director then found that the computer was filled with porn; it seemed that this is what he did for most of his 'working' hours. He was dismissed from his work-study job in the center BUT that's absolutely all that happened. No other form of rebuke or consequences at all. He continued in the program, continued to work with undergraduates, continued in his seminars with all of us, while several of his fellow graduate students continued to have to sit in the weirdly stained chair he left behind in the center. He took the rebuke so lightly, had so little shame, that he asked for his job back at the center the next year, apparently thinking that his perpetual masturbation in a public university office while on the clock really wasn't such a big deal. They didn't give him the job back, but that's the extent of negative consequence. He graduated and now holds a tenure track position at a different university. I see him at conferences regularly and often wonder, how does he interact with his undergraduates? And how is it that none of us thought to question whether this was a person who should be in a position of power vis-a-vis young vulnerable women? Or, rather, of course we questioned, but it never once occurred to us that we could do anything about it. After all, the administration knew already and did all but nothing. The fact that I'm still questioning, was this harassment? As if there should be any question that we all had a right to not be exposed to this guy's masturbation practices while at work, to not worry about seeing his erect penis while going about our work day, to not have to sit on the crusted remnants of semen he left behind....I write this and it sounds graphic, but in fact it's merely descriptive.

"male,social&humanities,Other R1,"I had spent a fair amount of time (a couple of hours) speaking with the chair of a different department at a social event at a university faculty retreat. I had no sexual or romantic interest in him and I made that clear by verbally telling him so at one point in the evening when I felt he crossed a line when he stated that he and I both seemed to have unmet needs. He backed off immediately so I let it go, especially since I believe he had been intoxicated at the time. I am not one to hold a grudge so we became Facebook friends, and that friendship stayed well within what I felt were appropriate boundaries: no more unwelcome advances from him, just mundane liking and commenting on each other's posts, and some good-natured trash talk about sports. Then a few months later our Dean asked me to take on additional responsibilities regarding program level assessment within the college, since that is an interest of mine. In addition to having me advise [the dean] on assessment related matters, she also made me available to the chairs of all the departments in the college so that they could consult with me on implementing best practices for assessing student learning outcomes in their respective programs. The individual in question sent me a private Facebook message telling me that the dean ""gave"" me to him and said that that I have to do whatever he said, and he then suggested that we meet up at the airport Holiday Inn every Friday night to ""talk assessment."" This disturbed me quite a bit, but because I didn't want to make waves I chose to pretend I didn't understand his implication and answered him in earnest that I would be willing to meet in the library with other staff members to talk about assessing his program. He responded by saying that he actually had no interest in talking about assessment and really just wanted to hang out with me, and that regardless of my answer he would still write a favorable letter on my behalf for my upcoming third-year review. This last part was particularly upsetting, because while I knew that I had nothing to fear about my third year review, I felt intimidated and disgusted that he felt so free to imply that he had any authority over my third year review and would dare to link that to his holiday inn invitation. At that point I stopped responding and deleted him as a friend. About a week later he emailed me to say that he had all but forgotten that exchange but just realized that it might have rubbed me the wrong way and that if it did he apologized because he had been drinking, he didn't mean anything inappropriate, and that he hoped we could still be friends. I responded saying that I appreciated his apology, but that I did not feel comfortable interacting with him in any way beyond the most professional capacity. I also told him that I would give him the benefit of the doubt and that I would not be discussing the incident with human resources. I said that last part mostly to make it crystal clear to him that I would be well within my rights to do so, my hope being that he would consider the severity of his actions and resolve to refrain from behavior like that in the future with other colleagues."male,social&humanities,Other R1,"I was explicitly told by a well-known Department Chair that the ""only reason they wouldn't consider hiring me was because you are a woman and young.""

I was stunned and backed out as quickly as possible. There's a lot of pressure in art school to be down with this kind of thing, and I knew the sexism of the whole scenario would be couched as ironic. Nevertheless I reported it - it pissed me off that my colleagues were using the state equipment for any private business, let alone one that objectified women's bodies. The grads got a slap on the hand. The custodian was reassigned, but only after my female colleague revealed that he had repeatedly pressured her to participate in the photo shoot. Reporting the incident permanently alienated me from these two grads and the entire clique of male students and professors that they were a part of.

At the orientation, my soon to be harasser walked by a group of new students and said ""are there any [students in my field] in here?"" and then instructed us all to call him by his first name. I loved that. My harasser was irreverent. He swore, wore jeans, and in general shook things up. He drank with his students, spent his free time outside of classes with us, and read my whole MA thesis to learn more about my research. I thought he was exactly what I wanted in a dissertation supervisor: someone invested in me and my work. He was a father to two young women, and I found him incredibly paternal. He looked out for grad students and would often pay for our meals and drinks. He agreed to be my supervisor. I went to Italy the summer of my first year, and when I came back, he took me and my friend for drinks. I remember that night he asked me how to say ""will you @#$%^& me"" in Italian. I brushed it off. That semester, I was applying for fellowships. I asked him if he would write me a letter of recommendation, and he agreed. He asked to meet to go over my CV, but I was worried that if we went out he would pay for everything again (like he always did), and I wanted to show that I was grateful for his time, so I invited him over to my house for dinner. I lived close to campus and couldn't drive, and he didn't have a car at the time, so it seemed like the best option. (I couldn't very well suggest we meet somewhere neither of us could get to without difficulty; my PhD institution was in the middle of nowhere). Also, the culture of the program was so informal that I didn't see anything wrong with this gesture. My roommates were home, and I had a boyfriend at the time. I wasn't worried about him. That night, he came over with a two-liter bottle of wine and proceeded to get very drunk. We talked about my work over dinner, and at the end, I got up to do the dishes. I felt him come up behind me and wrap his arms around my waist and start rubbing my hips. I moved to break away and pretended it never happened. Then, as we sat down, he said ""I'm going to be bad,"" and leaned forward to kiss me. I moved my head away. He tried again, and I remember his lips made contact with mine. I got up and suggested we go somewhere else--perhaps bike over to a bar. We agreed to bike to the one bar on campus and I went to grab a jacket and change my pants to ones I could bike in. When I came back into the room, he said he was just going to go home. At the time, I didn't quite understand what had happened that night. I know_延first and foremost--I felt bad for him. I was sure that because he was a father, he would wake up sober and feel terrible. I called my father, sister, and former supervisor, and we all agreed that keeping quiet and my head down would be best. But he spent the next six years terrorizing me. I dropped him off my committee, because I realized I could no longer work with him, and he told other professors in my department that we were no longer working together because I had plagiarized his work. (We work on completely different things). He went out of his way to make me feel small and pick on me as I made my way through my exams and prospectus phase. Then, things got much worse. Since I no longer had a supervisor, I began working_延in name, at least_延with the soon-to-be retired professor in my department who was in my field. When he retired, they hired someone new--a woman--and my harasser began dating her. Before I knew they had started dating, she and I chatted about my work, and she agreed to be my new supervisor. It made sense: she was the fancy new professor, and I couldn't keep working with someone who had retired. Also, she was a good and careful reader of my work, and I became quite fond of her. I dreaded that she would find out what her boyfriend did to me years ago, and at some point it did come out. I asked her to keep details of my job search from him, and to keep him away from me when she could. She didn't treat me differently, and I was grateful for that.But my last two years of grad school were deeply traumatizing. My harasser, probably emboldened by his relationship with my new supervisor, made my life a constant hell. When we were doing mock interviews for the job market, he volunteered to interview me. Multiple professors intervened, and he allegedly went around the department accusing me of slandering him. He showed up to my dissertation defense even though he was asked by multiple professors not to, glowered at me, grunted throughout, and then left in the middle. The worst came when I got a job offer at an excellent school (where I am now). I gave them--over the phone--my intent to accept, and asked them to send me a contract. At the same time, I emailed a school at which I was still under consideration to tell them of the offer. At that time, they told me I was first in line for their job as well. (Apparently, they made an offer to a woman, who, although originally accepting, had rescinded her acceptance. I emailed my supervisor and our university_验s job placement committee chair to ask what to do. It was late at night, and I wanted to know if I should negotiate with the first school, and whether or not I could recommend my friend to the second school. Before I even had a chance to write back to the second school, my harasser had written to them about his own student. He had found out the search had reopened, and wrote to them that night. This was extremely embarrassing for me, because nobody but me knew the search was back open, and it was obvious that the information had come from me. It was also horrible that I didn't have the chance to tell school #2 that I was accepting another offer before he wrote to them on behalf of _岩our school__延so I was told_延and for his student, whom they hadn't even interviewed. This was the last straw for me. I went, crying, to my supervisor's office, and then to the DGS, who told me that everyone knew my harasser was a sociopath, and that he wouldn't direct any more graduate students if he could help it. Nothing happened on this last point, of course. He is still directing graduate students."male,social&humanities,R2,"I had just interviewed for a tenure-track job and was sending out thank you emails to everyone who had met with me during my campus visit. It was late at night and a senior male professor wrote back to me immediately with message expressing how nice it had been to meet me. There was something indescribably 'off' about the syntax. Within the next twenty minutes he sent me a series of cell phone photographs of oxidizing bananas in which someone (presumably he) had cut a series of inscrutable but vaguely suggestive messages. It was creepy and I had no idea how to respond. I eventually wrote back ""I am not sure how to interpret these images,"" and he responded something along the lines of ""your presence delighted me and I wanted to share something that I thought would delight you."" I got the job and tried studiously to avoid this person, but there were a number of other incidents (which I will relay separately) in which he was creepy, inappropriate, and bullying to me in the extreme."male,natural,Small Liberal Arts College,"I am shy. There is a drinking culture in my department. I got drunk. For once, I felt comfortable sharing my views on a topic in an honest way. A fellow grad student ""felt a connection with me"" and kissed me, without my consent. I moved away and he did it again. There was no implied consent. I was frozen, and terrified, and I couldn't speak or move. I have past trauma so maybe this seems small to you but it greatly affected me. "male,NotAvailable,Elite Institution/Ivy League,"About 20 years ago a woman in her early 30s came to me because she didn't know what to do or who to go to. A man who was chair before the chair who hired me was still on the faculty. The previous chair had spent months in the early 80s ""seducing"" her while she was an undergraduate which included having sex in his department office. At the time she was flattered and considered it consensual. It was several years before she realized how abused she had been. We went together to the equity person (can't remember the name of the department but it was not ""equity"" until later). Apparently nothing had been done with the prior reports because it had ""only"" been 2 reports by different undergrads at different times. This time he was FINALLY fired. "male,NotAvailable,Small Liberal Arts College,"A male graduate student in my department would routinely hunt for a new unsuspecting female graduate student every new student orientation. He especially liked single mothers in our department. He would be charming at first and then ridiculously controlling.

Very few of my colleagues came, but the banana-incising senior colleague (reference to my previous post) did. During the course of the discussion, he said, apparently out of the blue, ""I am guided in everything I do by the breasts of [name of mutual female student, also present.]"" The room had a spasm of discomfort as everyone looked to the student he had named. She initiated some anxious laughter and I tried to steer the discussion back on track. A couple of days later, I spoke to the student who minimized the comment. It apparently was a reference to a performance artwork that she had recently made in his class, but it was not in any way germane to the discussion. I pointed out that I had a legal obligation to report harassment and that his bringing up her breasts publicly, without the context of the performance, was inappropriate and could have a chilling effect on female students. She was adamant that did not want to pursue a complaint. I sought the counsel of my faculty mentor, who was furious and told me she was going to report it. She wanted to keep me out of it because the senior colleague had a reputation of retaliation. An investigation ensued, which the senior professor easily traced back to me because I was the only colleague present and the only one who had a responsibility to report his inappropriate comment. The senior colleague then proceeded to place ads in the alternative arts newsweekly in which he used hand-drawn comics to explain away his behavior and portray me as a worthless artist in league with the nefarious administration to end free speech and free artistic expression. The student whose breasts had been discussed publicly did not want to participate in the investigation, and the investigation became politicized, as the department administration was pushing very hard to paint him as unstable to get rid of a professor who had long been a thorn in their side. I was not involved in any of this, but it's my analysis from afar. Eventually, this strategy backfired, and my senior colleague was cleared of the harassment charges. He celebrated his exoneration with a Facebook post calling me and the chair of the department out by name for our unsuccessful attempt to destroy him. A couple of years later the student whose breasts he had discussed publicly told me that he had pursued and harassed her after graduation and that she wishes she had pursued the investigation.

He spent several class sessions talking about it and explaining how all women have a ""rape fantasy"". He even quizzed us on it and made us write about it. It was humiliating for me and the other women in the class. But when a professor has power over your grade and your reputation and your ability to move on to the next course or fail, most people don't want to rock the boat or cause problems. It seemed like all the women were afraid to say anything for fear of getting a bad grade. He was a very intimidating man.

At that point I thought the incident was my thought. I was wearing a dress. I was extremely embarrassed afterwards. It was 2010. Co-advisor never said a word after that. Never apologized. Rounds of manuscript review came with extra harsh comments that were not directed at improvement, but humiliation. **In grad school again for PhD, grad student fellow from the same lab and office space harassed me during my entire first semester. Everyone commented about how in love he was and how harsh I was on him. Once, he sat on my lap and put his arms at my shoulder. I remember wanting to disappear while that happened. The entire situation made me extremely uncomfortable to the point I would avoid going to my office when I knew he was there. I remember repeatedly stating to colleagues I wanted nothing to do with lab mates in that regard and how inappropriate that situation was. The behavior ceased to give rise to rivarly. It caused me a major depression episode. ***when I was a GTA, undergraduate student wrote me a letter with inappropriate content on the back of his exam. I reportedly it to the university.

I had to have that conversation with the student using the course supervisor (male) as a witness. Course supervisor offered a lot of support in the situation.

We first met in a formal setting, I made an appointment to ask about American academic culture. We also kept running into each other in town. At some point, months later, he asked me out. Being from a different culture (both social and academic), I did not find it strange that an older guy who happened to be a professor openly expressed interest in me. He often told me how obsessed he was with me, he ''complimented'' me using rather explicit language. It was a consensual on and off relationship. I was an adult, and I took (and still take) responsibility for my actions/choices. However, he always insisted on keeping this relationship a secret. He would say ""don't tell anybody, or I will get in trouble"". I never really understood that: there was no conflict of interest... being from different departments, our professional paths didn't really cross. I told my friends about him. I felt the need to have witnesses, so to speak. I didn't feel safe, emotionally. He often said how he was obsessed with me, how he wanted to posess me. I thought- it's weird, this guy seems to be really into me, but yet he doesn't want to be seen with me in public. Emotionally and sexually, I felt used, disrespected. I knew l was being treated as a sex toy in this situation. I was lucky I wasn't in love with him. Several times I broke it off, then he would beg me to spend time with him again, using the same possessive language. At some point, the interactions stopped. I've always wondered if he had a full-time girlfriend, and I was a side-chick. I also wondered if he had been simultaneously dating other students.

Over time, our conversations became less platonic on his instigation, and he moved from complimenting my smarts to complimenting my looks; I was initially flattered by what I naively thought of as romantic interest, then increasingly creeped out as he became more explicitly sexual. At one point he asked to call me on the phone, then during the call described the size of his penis and talked about it growing erect, asked me if the description made me aroused, and asked me to talk dirty to him. He also asked whether he could visit me after I went to college; I politely deflected that.We stopped talking a little while after that, which was a huge relief for me. I didn't hear from him again until I was a grad student, out of the blue: the institution I attended for my Ph.D. was the same one he'd gone to for undergrad, and I suppose he must have visited for an alumni reunion.

I was so freaked out that I decided to skip trying to bike in Manhattan and just get a cab. He followed me out and when a cab stopped for me, he tried to push me and himself in. I braved myself against the doorframe and pushed him off. The next morning he emailed to say he had a great time and we should do it again. Years later I filed a report against him. The only reprimand that the EOE office had for him was to stop drinking with individual students. He was extremely uncomfortable but relaxed when they recounted the details (a sign that he had done something worse with someone else, perhaps?). He said he wouldn_验t be able to do his food studies job, be himself, without being able to drink with students.

I realized that a smarter way to pay for my education habit would be to be a faculty member. I was told about an employment opportunity in the university in which I was a student. I went to an office to speak with the Secretary to the Director. She scheduled an appointment with the Director. I arrived for that appointment, sat across the desk from the Director, and noticed a ""Post-it Note"" (signed by the Secretary) on the Director's desk. Reading the note upside down, I discovered that (in Spanish) it said, "" ________ __________ 01:00 p.m. Hire him. He is a stud."" The Director was ~ 31 years young. I was ~ 26 years young. She scheduled an interview with a committee (but, told me that the job was mine. Nobody else would be interviewed). After I had been hired, she told me that my first day on the job would be spent flying to San Luis Obispo to participate in a conference. When we arrived and were carrying our bags into the hotel, she told me that I did not need to occupy a separate room. Oh yes I did!!!!!!! That comment certainly made me uncomfortable. As the weeks of the job went on, she would introduce me to other women telling them that she had hired me because of that note from the Secretary. If I had been pale-skinned, I know that one could have seen that I was blushing. Those comments certainly did make me uncomfortable. When I arrived in that major research university (during the 1970s), I was told by male faculty members and by male students that the unwritten rules of dating were such that; when a man took a woman on a date and paid for a meal in a nice restaurant, the woman reciprocated by inviting him into her body. I never, ever would consider such disrespectful behavior. However, my boss consistently would tell me. ""Your taking me to dinner."" I would take her to ""Taco Time"" and pay for her meal. No matter how flirtatious she was, I would not respond in any unprofessional way. I did not want any relationship with her other than our professional one as administrative, student-services faculty members in the same program.I was invited to apply for a faculty position in another institution of higher education (which desperately needed somebody who could teach Mathematics in Spanish and in English). I did not remain two years in that first uncomfortable job. I probably was helped (in dealing with the boss who wanted me for my body) by being married to the most beautiful woman in the world. Those many experiences with that person did not give me any PTSD. I did not lose sleep because of them. I did not report them to any university administrators in levels of more authority. I finished a B. Sci., M. Sci., and Ph.D. without ever accepting one penny of financial aid, scholarship funds, fellowship funds, student loans, etc. I finished with no debt.

I am also 1 of 2 graduate students involved; everyone else has at least one award-winning book out. The group went out for dinner the night before the conference. Drinks were had; I am an outgoing person and had a lot of fun chatting with those around me. One person from the gendered-male framing field I had never met before or read any of his work. We got along really well and when he mentioned that his daughter was a year younger than me I felt assured that nothing creepy was going on. The next day at lunch, he again sits next to me and asks me if I want to go out to a sports event after the conference concludes the next day; because he is one of the conference organizers, he knows my flight leaves the next morning and I am spending another night in town. I start to get wigged out by how he is isolating me from the group, and the fact that he seems to not want anyone else to hear this invitation, so I blow him off saying I think I need to be conducting research in the local archives, I need to check the holdings, etc. The next day, the final day of the conference he asked me over breakfast again about accompanying him to the sporting event and this time I firmly declined and just said I couldn't. He ignored me all day and except to be dismissive of my paper while everyone else was positive/constructive.Months later, I hear through another one of the editors of the volume that ""they just can't have a whole chapter on [my topic]"" with no other explanation given. Other workshop participants I see at conferences occasionally follow up with me and ask how my chapter is going, reiterate excitement about my work; they are amazed and confused when I tell them my chapter was cut. I have *no* proof that it is because I declined this guy's invitation, but my advisor confirms it's the only thing that makes sense, as does the other graduate student who was at the workshop, with whom I have become good friends.

It happened so quickly there was no question of my giving consent, much less informed consent (I was 16 years old, though he waited until after my 17th birthday to break my hymen). He was 34 at the time. I later learned that my relationship with him hadn't been as ""special"" as I thought; he seduced a number of girls at the school, some of whom I later met. Fun fact: he ""didn't know how"" to use a condom, so he didn't.

The morning of the lab's holiday party, he threw one of his legendary verbal tantrums, and I happened to be the target. I was furious. That afternoon at the party, still enraged, I simply ignored him. I refused to engage with him or even look in his direction. But I could see in my peripheral vision that he kept looking across the crowded room over in my direction, trying to catch my eye. I continued to stare straight ahead. He walked toward me in my direction and I continued to stare straight ahead. And then walked behind me, slowly dragging his knuckles across my backside as he passed. He said nothing.

"male,social&humanities,Small Liberal Arts College,"When I was a first-year undergraduate I sang in a choir associated with a university chapel. There was a party for the choir and chapel staff; alcohol was provided by the staff, and we were all encouraged to drink a lot. I was clearly very drunk: slurring my words, off balance, confused. One of the assistant chaplains, a lecturer in the university, aggressively and single-mindedly tried to chat me up and take me home: we were sitting on a sofa in the middle of the room and no one stepped in, even though they could see he was touching me extremely inappropriately and I was incapable of consent.

I had a friendly and close working relationship with my (gay) male advisor. This other professor often saw us walking together on campus, and he assumed that must mean we were sleeping together. When he saw me with my advisor, he would remark on us being together and how close we were; he didn't outright come out and say it, but it was obvious by his tone of voice and body language what he was insinuating. My advisor and I mostly laughed it off. But a few weeks later, I saw the other professor walking past my apartment as my (also gay) male boss was dropping off a 'duty'/on call phone (I worked for the university) at my front door one morning. The other professor later cornered me at the campus center when I was getting food and asked who the guy at my front door had been. I sort of awkwardly responded that he was my boss and started to explain that he was dropping off a phone for work when he interrupted me and said, ""so he's *also* someone you work for?"" The implication that he thought I was sleeping with both my advisor and my boss was pretty clear. I think I stammered out an explanation of some sorts, but it was apparent he didn't believe me.

I don't need anybody else getting pregnant."" His assistant in his home department had just had a baby, and he made frequent remarks like this. He was not often around, but during meetings he would make sexist jokes or jokes about feminism/feminists. His relationship with the ED made everyone uncomfortable (from the way they behaved together to what she did on company time for him--including making personal appointments for him, buying him gifts, cleaning his personal home on work time, etc.). The way he talked to some of the women and a student worker made us uncomfortable. He and the ED were always together when he was in the office and she was the gatekeeper to any interaction with him. Backstage during a public event, myself, colleagues, and several volunteers saw her kiss him and call him ""Papa."" Another colleague whose job duties required her to be in close contact during events mentioned that he was very handsy with the ED and would often touch her butt. People in other departments expressed concern to me about the nature of their relationship. One asked me, ""Is she a starfucker?"" I hadn't even initiated the conversation, but people offered up their thoughts. Donors referred to us, an all woman staff, as the ""[Director's name] Girls."" It was embarrassing and demeaning. I had issues with my direct manager that I frequently had to address with the ED, but when I brought my concerns up she chuckled and brushed it off saying, ""Well, we are an office full of women."" This is someone who had previously been in leadership roles with university women's programs. I was also verbally chastised whenever I put any of my work concerns in e-mail or any other trackable form, which made it harder to address issues because she was never in the office to speak with. She was allowed to do whatever and come and go as she pleased, often staying unresponsive so long that everything became one ongoing fire to manage. I was usually vocal about this -- even speaking to the Director about it. As a result, I was marked off on my performance evaluation for ""having a tendency to air my grievances to the group,"" and my direct manager accused me of creating a toxic work environment (even though all the staff had the same issues with the leadership team). My direct manager--who had just openly accused me of toxicity--then held a private meeting with me, asked me to promise not to tell anyone what she was about to say to me, and told me she also had issues with what was happening there and that I should definitely go to HR.

This year a sexual harassment claim was filed against the (now former) Chair; most of us are entirely unsurprised by this. In fact, we're surprised there's only one (though another student has apparently come forward).

They generally left me alone, but once they tried to pressure me to let the work sit for a while and go out with them to happy hour. I declined and stayed behind to complete my work. As they left, my major professor said he ""had something for me"" and would ""see me later."" That night, the doorbell to my apartment rang at 2:00 in the morning. (I lived alone.) It was my professor, who was completely soused. I let him in. The something he had for me was a massive bag of weed, which he wanted to smoke with me. I declined. He sat down on the couch and rolled some joints. I sat at the other end of the couch while he got high. He stayed all night, occasionally dozing off, waking, talking moderately coherently about his marriage, his wife, other things. When the sun came up, I told him I thought he should go so that we could both get ready for class, which was at 9:00 a.m. He left."male,NotAvailable,Other Research Agency,My physics lab partner of two years groped me and put me down verballys.A elderly visiting professor (history) kissed me in my car when I gave him a ride home.A fellow student was told she should change her thesis subject from military operations to mothers of soldiers because she was a woman.male,social&humanities,Regional Teaching College,"The faculty member pretended to have an interest in mentoring me.

Asked to wipe chalkboard and he pressed himself against me from behind. Looked down my blouse. Commented on my size, saying I was getting bigger. "male,social&humanities,Other R1,"These incidents took place within the current century; I prefer not to be more specific. I and several other untenured women in my department were subjected to unwelcome sexual comments and jokes by a male full professor. The same individual used degrading sexist and sexualized language in public settings and yelled at and belittled female colleagues, especially those junior to him. Reporting drew further aggression. "male,natural,Small Liberal Arts College,"My grad program (late nineties, early 2000's) had a culture of constantly accusing people of having affairs. WIth the possible exception of undergrads, people at all ranks participated, including support staff. Sometimes these accusations were within the bounds of moral condemnation, I.e., people claimed to have uncovered abuse of a subordinate, but often they were just a sort of malicious slash fiction, with political allies or even people who worked in similar areas accused of having sex with one another, with their grad students, with their famous dissertation directors, etc. It was never clear to me as a student what sparked a particular story; after a while, one simply expected a new one every semester. As I think on it I realize that the accusations always hit those who could conceivably move on from the department--successful grads, junior fac, and the few minor stars among associate and fulls--never the deadwood, and never the rooted locals among students. So it was a kind of accusation of treason or disloyalty, really: how dare you desire more than this. The situation was particularly grim because the city was small, and many faculty and grad students lived and drank in a particular neighborhood only about three-quarters of a mile in diameter; one was literally surveilled in one's private life. This gossip was spread in person, in e-mails, and I have heard reports that there were (implicitly homophobic) allegations against a man (associate prof) in the men's room, as a graffito that was not removed for a long time. At least one person who was a target of what I knew to be false (and again homophobic) rumors spread similar rumors about a colleague, in apparent good faith, and rather carelessly, as an item of mild entertainment. I think perhaps they were not aware of the comparatively more vicious accusations that had been leveled against them, and did not perceive a broader culture of abuse-by-slander. We all lost our moral bearings utterly, I think. Eventually, I was accused of sleeping with my director, or rather...not accused directly but suddenly treated as an object of ridicule, with the obvious inference being continually re-drawn. There was zero basis for the rumor other than the fact that we had a congenial relationship, but there were many occasions when I was suddenly asked loaded questions by smirking people I didn't know well, and one memorable incident when I waved hi to some acquaintances (an ABD woman and a full professor man) at an MLA, only to have them pause, glance at eachother, laugh loudly and incredulously in my face, and walk away. ;The worst part is, even while being aghast at my own mistreatment, I didn't question many of the rumors I heard about others; I merely congratulated myself on a relative lack of prudishness, or occasionally felt superior because I had good evidence that a particular story was false. Since the ones I knew were false were also the ones that would have been serious abuses of power (involving students), I was complacent. Today, I recognize someone that I believed false stories about in this spreadsheet, and I feel terrible for not being more careful about what I accepted and did not accept as true. I don't think I ever met or spoke to that person except in passing, but I offer her my apologies nonetheless. It seems obvious that her career was profoundly damaged by this situation, and while I couldn't have prevented that, I could have substituted empathy for facile cynicism. "male,social&humanities,Other R1,"A full professor, Chair of the Department, married, commented on the photo included with my application file (I believe it was on a copy of my passport, but I do not remember), when we looked at my file in the departmental manager's office together. I do not remember why we did that; only that it was for some administrative purpose. He said I looked like a Swedish actress. (I am female and had short, blond hair in the photo.) I did not make anything of it at the time. - Yet, months later, we discussed my seminar paper at his temporary summer apartment in Berlin, in Germany. I disagreed with his critique of my approach and defended it. Suddenly, in developing/repeating his counter argument, he drew a comparison involving the lamp next to the table we were sitting on and my hair color. I remember very little about what happened next. I remember that I left his apartment as fast as possible and felt afraid (I was shaking), confused, shocked, surprised, disappointed, and ashamed, all at the same time. "male,social&humanities,Elite Institution/Ivy League,"In my first year I was openly told to remove myself from courses that I was struggling with after I asked the professor leading the class for additional resources to help me keep up. This type of commentary continued when I took another class in the spring with another professor (a good friend of the first). At the end of the spring semester, I confronted the latter about potentially needing an exam deferral due to my mother being diagnosed with cervical cancer. The second professor responded, ""Don't worry, she'll be okay. My Mom had breast cancer and she's boobless now. It'll all work out."" I found out days later that they had granted an exception to a male student to have the exam emailed to them as they would be out of the country the day it was scheduled. Days after the exam, I received an email from them wishing my Mother well without actually apologizing for what was said. After a year of repeatedly being told I wasn't good enough to stay in the course sequence , I abandoned working with those faculty and turned my work in a different direction. When reminiscing about this experience with a peer this Fall, they told me the faculty member for the second course had openly admitted that they didn't believe their female students were as smart as their male students. "male,social&humanities,Elite Institution/Ivy League,"A tenured faculty member in the social sciences created an extremely hostile work environment for me while I was a tenure-track assistant professor. He constantly engaged in highly inappropriate behavior, including graphic discussions about sex, pornography, and his own fantasies about raping various women. He was obsessed with any new woman who was hired on the faculty, and he repeated this pattern with me and others, including attempts to insinuate himself into my personal life, and attempts to alienate me from other colleagues with lies and other manipulative behavior. He thrived on his attempts to gas light me and various other women, including faculty, staff, and students. He practically lived on campus, there all hours of the day and night, seven days a week. It was impossible to avoid him on such a small campus. He was a popular and charismatic instructor, and made sure you knew of his _岩power_ on campus because of it. This man is a serial predator and abuser. After I left, I heard from former students who had horrific stories to tell about how he had abused them (many offenses for which he should be terminated). All asked me to keep their confidence, and I have, but it is an awful burden to bear."male,social&humanities,Elite Institution/Ivy League,"My professor propositioned me for sex after an evening of grooming (ex. telling me that I was really smart and attractive). I adamantly refused his propositioning only to have him try to persuade me against my wishes. I continued to push back, but remained polite so as not to ruin the evening or the friendly, professional relationship I thought I'd built with this person. When I asked for him to drive me home, he proceeded to try to push me for sex again, which I refused. During the ride, he remarked how his girlfriend wouldn't have approved if we'd chosen to get to together (his girlfriend was a former student of his, somehow even younger than myself)."male,social&humanities,Other R1,sexual harrassment at a field site as a recent post-graduatemale,natural,Other R1,"I was lucky enough to be spared sexual harassment. I have been a postdoc & PhD student in 4 different institutions with 4 different white, high status, heterosecual male professors. Some of them were more supportive then otheres. I have seen good and bad research practices. With one of them, who had a particularly ""difficult"" character, I did end up having an interpersonal conflict and I did feel bullied and intimidated fir a while. Eventually the working relationship fell apart as we felt it wasn't working for us. Some (but not all) other people in the group had a similar experiences with this person. Nonetheless there was no sexual harassment over the 10 years. I do sometimes get harassed on the street etc. but not at work. I'm also aware about gender bias in academia and I do think being female has stalled my career progress a lot. However I'm now in my first faculty position at a very good institution and I feel happy and safe. There are no harassers here and not even bullies (Phew!). Perhaps I got lucky? Or perhaps social psychology is more civilized than other fields? Maybe my demeanour at work conveys that I won't put up with shit from people? Maybe it's because everyone knows I'm in a long term relationship? Who knows... Anyway... I'm not trying to deny that sexual harassment exists. It does exist and is terrible and unacceptable, but some of us are lucky enough not to face it that much. I count my blessings.

"female,natural,Other R1,"2014-2015 school year over two semesters when he was teaching two required courses for my first year of graduate school. Professor in my department sexually harassed me and a number of other female students. In my case, he would insist that I meet with him (instead of the TA for the course). When I would get to his office, he would insist that I close the door, even though I said I was fine with it open. Then he would insist that I sit right next to him on his side of the desk (instead of sitting across the desk from him like I originally did). When I offered resistance to that request he insisted and implied that he wouldn't help me unless I moved. Once I was sitting next to him he would then put his hands on my back and/or shoulders while explaining concepts to me. I had been warned he was ""handsy"" in his office and so I always sat so that he couldn't touch my thighs like I had been warned he did to other students. When another student filed a complaint against him, he attempted multiple times to intimidate me into not providing testimony against him. "female,natural,Small Liberal Arts College,"I was TA for an undergraduate who wrote a very sexually explicit poem directed at me, ""a goddess in business attire,"" and attached it to his paper ""because he was a creative writing major and was so inspired by the visual analysis assignment.""

I began the course and just participated normally. The professor drew a LOT of attention to comments I made in class--even when I was absent, making me feel uncomfortable and causing many students in the course to recognize it as strange. To avoid interaction with the professor, I sat in the back of the class and refrained from participating for the rest of semester, limiting my own benefit from this core educational requirement, in order to avoid sexual harassment."male,classics,Other Type of School,"About 13 yrs ago, I shared an office with a well-known, middle-aged professor, who occasionally taught in the department. It started with complaints about his marriage. And I was appalled by overtly sexist things he would say to female undergraduates during office hours, eg ""did your boyfriend help you with this?"" By Feb, he began to kiss the top of my head when exiting the office.

This became a pattern, even past graduation. Female students joked about how they knew not to arrive late to his class, as they would end up sitting next to him and he would habitually stroke or touch the arms of any female students sitting beside him (never male). After an event with wine which both students and faculty members attended, numerous female students shared stories of this professor placing his arm around them and giving them a squeeze, stroking their faces flirtatiously, commenting upon their age in a jokingly flirty manner, and referring to them as ""sweetheart."""male,social&humanities,Elite Institution/Ivy League,"As a student, PhD candidate taught undergraduate courses that I was in. I was in 2nd year (19 years old). He was well known to have dated students in the past and attempt to pick up students who had just finished his courses. He added me on Facebook while still being my prof and communicated with me only through this medium. During the class, he had shown a film that had an explicit rape scene in it. He presented this as a ""competition"" to see how long individuals could stay in the classroom without being ""triggered"". He suggested we put a list on the door of students who leave first and ridicule them later. All female students left the classroom. I had gone to the chair of the department but no follow-up was done. When I had graduated, I ran into this prof again and he had begun messaging me on Facebook with explicitly sexual messages, stating that he had thought about me in this way when I was his student. I connected with a few other students who had similar experiences. One student had reported escalating stalking behaviour, constant texting and calls, writing of elaborate love letters, sending of porn and screaming at her in public university spaces for ignoring his requests for dates (again, as soon as she had finished his course). He stated that he would think about her sexually when she gave presentations alone in his office and spoke in class. He had a long history of female students feeling like he was ""just everywhere"" they went. I had once seen him walk past my apartment building and ran into him constantly also. Reported this to a conflict resolution person at the university and external investigator was brought in. His contract was terminated but no canvassing was done to evaluate the harm he had done despite his reputation over the last five years being made very clear. Myself and other student were told that we had no right to speak of these incidents and that if we were to go public, there would be consequences, despite no signing of any non disclosure agreements. The investigator found him guilty of harassment.

He would frequently talk to me about his interest in certain women. and my rocky relationship with my boyfriend at the time who was an alcoholic and increasingly becoming abusive. During one of these one-on-one talks in his apartment, he revealed that he was having a relationship with a student in the class he was teaching. I strongly advised him not to do this, and asked if it was against the school's policy since she was a current student. We argued about it back and forth. I was in the midst of writing my thesis. He never again invited me to his apartment. After the class was over, he never responded to my emails--from drafts of my thesis, to signing papers ensuring I would graduate. I finally kept pestering the department administrator to get him to sign things until all documents were completed. Now, looking back on it, I know that he was ghosting me--using his power as my adviser, to make it known that he pulled the strings. A kind of silent threat for me not to report what he was doing to anyone. "male,social&humanities,Other R1,"I was at the 2013 national meeting of the American Nuclear Society in Washington DC. In the evening, I went to a bar with many colleagues for an LGBTQ+ mixer (I am a bisexual female). I dressed for going out: simple black satin shorts with pantyhose, flats, a blouse and a blazer. After a couple of drinks I decided to take a cab back to the hotel and, since everyone was staying at the same hotel, I invited my close colleagues to share the cab if anyone was also ready to leave. Only one person joined me. In the back of the cab, we didn't have much to talk about at that late hour, so I closed my eyes and crossed my arms. Although he knew I was in a long-term committed relationship with someone, my colleague reached over and slid his hand up my shorts. Without opening my eyes (why wasn't I surprised by his action) I reached down, moved his hand back to his side of the cab and we never spoke of the incident again. "female,NotAvailable,NotAvailable,"My professor asked me to have sex with him while we were alone and working on processing tissue on a Saturday. This proposition followed months of him taking me out for coffee under the guise of mentor ship, where he increasingly positioned himself on a pedestal relative to me, and tossed in questions about my sexual preferences and past in the context of a burgeoning friendship. He was in an unhappy marriage, didn't have many friends, and described his personal life with her at length to me. I answered his questions by carefully skirting around them and re-directing the conversation to neutral ground: he didn't seem bothered by my lack of engagement in any of it, and seemed relieved for an opportunity to share his thoughts and feelings freely (he should have just gone to therapy). When I rejected the proposition to have sex with him (which shocked me) I stammered that I wasn't comfortable mixing business and pleasure. He became defensive and embarrassed. I attempted to play it off, and in the moment, believed that I had done so, and left the incident behind me. Two weeks later we met in his office to go over the things I needed to begin my next set of experiments. He closed the door and told me I didn't deserve any of it, had an arrogant and entitled approach to science, and that unless I mended our relationship, would never have a future in science since he held all power over my future. Further, he reneged on a previously arranged agreement to allow me flexibility to TA for additional semesters to make my financial ends meet. He forbid me to find external employment, and told me just to deal with it - knowing I was under financial duress. I reported it to my department head, who made a note in a file, and asked me if I wanted to switch labs. I was asked if he touched me, if I had any proof of explicit messages, or if anyone had borne witness. Of course, I had none of these things. Since this was the only lab in the entire school doing the kind of work I was interested in, I stuck it out. My supervisor didn't speak to me for an entire year, and I completed the remainder of my experiments alone.

The project involved many hours in the field working with specialized equipment (on which he trained me). While working together, he would constantly ask me questions about my relationship status, my sexual experiences, and what the inside of my bedroom looked like. When we were working together on the equipment, he would also stand so close behind me that he was literally breathing down my neck, and would also try to rub my shoulders until I objected verbally. The most memorable incident happened when he was driving me out to a field site. He was eating a fast food hamburger, and some ketchup dripped into his lap. He handed me a napkin and ordered me to wipe the stain off of his crotch (which I refused to do). I eventually complained to my adviser, and he told my harasser that the behavior had to stop or the project would be cancelled. It did... for about a week, then gradually the behavior crept back in. Fortunately, the project ended soon after, but the harasser kept calling me every few months on my personal cell phone for about five years afterward ""just to chat."""male,social&humanities,Other Type of School,2014male,social&humanities,Other R1,"Over the course of ten years as a postdoc and research scientist, I have received repeated, unwelcome stares and comments about my looks from my advisor (such as ""I REALLY LIKE that skirt!"").

This pressure continued for months despite my repeated declarations that I was not interested. Unfortunately, despite my best judgment, I eventually gave in and started dating him. It quickly became evident that this was not a relationship that would work for me. He was emotionally abusive and unbearably narcissistic. I tried to break it off with him multiple times, but each time he made life at work a living hell, and eventually I would succumb to his advances just to quell the non-stop barrage of verbal and emotional abuse (although obviously it was still abuse to be coerced into a relationship like this). When I finally ended it for the last time, he of course made my life a living hell again at work...as I had feared. This was a problem because he was specializing in an analytical technique I needed for my research project and he was supposed to be mentoring me for that component of my research. But it wasn't just that he refused to help me. He took it a step further and was a cruel bully to me in the workplace. For example, he regularly told me I wasn't smart enough for the program. Any time I had a question, any time I made a small mistake, sometimes out of the blue for no reason at all. He would remind me of my inferiority. He even went as far as to spread horrible rumors about me to other graduate students in our program. Some of the rumors were sexual in nature. Others were about my ""incompetence"" in our field. These rumors socially isolated me from the rest of the group. "male,social&humanities,NotAvailable,"I was a Research Assistant for a famous older male professor who visited my R1 university each year. A few weeks into the quarter, he asked me to get him a stack of books from the library, and then requested I bring them up to his hotel room. Once I was there, he asked me what I was doing that weekend and invited me out to dinner on Saturday night. I immediately felt profoundly uncomfortable being alone with him in his hotel room.

After about a year or so of pleasant, occasional, and exclusively collegial acquaintance (mainly through email or the occasional meeting), I began receiving emails from this older colleague telling me he had 'reviewed my work' and he was 'aggrieved' to tell me that he had found it to be 'horribly inadequate.' There followed an exegesis of several pages attacking some of my previously published work. The attacks involved very minor details. There were veiled threats if I refused to prove receptive to more of these diatribes. I immediately informed him I was not interested in receiving these 'critiques' and asked him to cease contact altogether. A few months later, we were both at the same conference, and he followed around (stalked me). I knew he would also be at the conference, and strongly considered not attending, but there were many other old friends I wanted to see there.

Part of this relationship was built on young women's willingness to confide in this mentor, including private information about sexual relationships and assertion to these graduate students that they could only be successful with the support of this mentor. Mentor often referenced his own sex life with his wife, made flirtatious comments to women mentees about his desire to pursue a relationship with them, and commented on the physical attractiveness and bodies of these mentees and other women in public spaces.

There was a barely noticeable sexual vibe during our meetings, so I just brushed it off. I was just starting my PhD program and getting the support from this man meant a whole lot. One time we met to discuss my summer research plans and I told him I needed to get funding. He proceeded to ask how much money I needed and offered to pay for it. I was completely shocked and confused, not knowing how to respond. A red flag went off in the back of my mind because I felt that accepting his personal money would move the relationship in a more personal direction. I quickly thanked him but said that there was no need because I was applying for department funding. Something told me to stay away from this man and I eventually changed my research topic (not necessarily directly related to this). I always felt weird about this incident and there was no one I could process it with. Was I just really lucky? Should I have taken the money? Was he just that vested in my research? Would his wife (also a prominent professor on campus) know about this? Would it be a gift coming from both of them? I haven't processed this with any of my grad program friends because they all work with this man and they all see him as an academic father figure. Its a small weird episode, but I share it because this man is a powerful force at my institution and this is the only place where I feel safe sharing it.

If a woman dared to bend over or anything, he would make a suggestive comment. The worst for me was when he took a broom handle and forcefully shoved it between my legs and nearly into my vagina from behind when I was not looking. When he was reported to the department manager (a woman) by several of us, he claimed psychological stress due to his sexual orientation, and was given the highest promotion in the department.

First, a professor currently under investigation for sexual harassment and rape, whose inappropriate partying with students was an open secret, joked about running me over because I _岩wasn_验t fun_ when I went home from the bar instead of back to his house with the other students, both male and female. I got disgusted by the drunkenness, sexual aggression, and belittling/shutting down of women when they tried to talk about their ideas and walked home rather than ride with my friends to his house. Glad I did, because he has numerous allegations of assault. Second, a member of my dissertation committee in my PHD program _岩joked_ with a male grad student at a university event where we were all conversing at the after/social event. They were talking about a famous scholar who got divorced and married his female grad student. The professor, married to another prof, said that if his wife didn_验t stay in line he could always hook up with one of his grad students (I was his only female grad student in this discussion). All the men laughed and I got infuriated. It felt demeaning to both me as his student and to his wife. I responded that since his wife was also a professor, she could do the same. He later apologized, but I always felt after that I had to chase down this professor to get his feedback and letters of recommendation. Now that I_验m done and in the job market I wish I had just dropped him from my committee as his support is still minimal.

I was shocked by how accepting everyone seemed of this. I spoke to the HoD, asking - are these rumours true? He said they were, but wrung his hands, saying, ""there's nothing we can do."" I was devastated! He said if confronted, the colleague would simply lie, subtly pointing out that the man's wife was head of HR for the whole University. He said - what I will do is move the student out of his office, which they were sharing(!). He got her her own office, and that was meant to be that. I looked up the University's code of ethics governing staff-student relationships and you could drive a truck through it. It turned out he'd written it. I felt sick about it all but couldn't see any action to take, particularly given other colleagues were turning a blind eye. One who worked in feminist philosophy remarked that the students concerned were over the age of consent and she didn't hold with 'seeing women as victims'. A few years later a complaint came in from the high schools where we taught Ethics and guess who was super-keen to go out there and deliver it? The complaint was about inappropriate contact after hours (texting) with a 16 year old girl. I was so upset. The University only investigated after certain people pushed hard from inside. I never found out the results, and the colleague remained in place until he died of alcohol-related illness. What I want to comment on re. all this is that given the colleague was employed for over 30 years, how very many female students must have been caught up in the behaviour - and what happened to their educations? (If any are reading this, please consider that you may have been abused, even if you thought it was consensual.)

And he unzipped his pants and masturbated in front of me while I sat, frozen, on the couch.I don't remember much of anything after he began masturbating. I was very frightened that my refusal of his advances would somehow be turned against me in my internship in the Counseling Center--especially since he had called me a tease. We didn't have any further interactions after that night that I can recall."male,social&humanities,Elite Institution/Ivy League,"Harassment coupled with severe slander and defamation over several years. I started a course in History at UCL and the lecturer in question seemed like a very nice and dedicated individual whom I greatly respected and admired. He started staring at me (pretty much systematic behaviour), being rude to me, spying on me and other weirdo and inappropriate behaviour. When I started questioning his behaviour and eventually complained, he simply passed me off as crazy (on the basis of my medical condition- I technically suffer from depression) while persisting with his behaviour. "male,social&humanities,Small Liberal Arts College,"2006. I was at a get-together in the hotel room of a prominent scholar in my field after a conference. As a graduate student, I kept my own drinking to a minimum around colleagues. By the time I had arrived at this party, it was clear that just about everyone had had one too many. I was chatting with my advisor's inebriated partner when she reached out and rubbed my groin. I felt humiliated and feared who might have seen it, so I rushed out into the hallway. She tried to apologize, and when I wasn't having any of it, she said that if I reported it, no one would believe me and she would sabotage me with her husband. This is literally the first time, I'm writing about this."male,social&humanities,Small Liberal Arts College,"I was at first sexually harassed by a colleague and friend. He was in a more senior position than mine and he constantly told me that he wanted to date me, thought I was hot etc. I had constantly explained he was just my friend. I had no other friends-- i had just moved to the university from western Canada and he had become my only friend.I continued to try to maintain a friendship because he was a work colleague but i stopped spending time with him.Finally I caved to his requests to spend time together. He knew I was struggling with studying for classes so he offered to help me study and explain some concepts to me. That night he sexually assaulted me in my residence when I fell asleep when I was studying (He was there to help me study as he had done similar grad school work). I had said no several times but he just still did it. After he got off me I walked straight into the bathroom and turned on the shower and started sobbing. He just left the apartment without saying a word.I tried to make sense of what he had done. Tried to make it ok for me. So I flirted with him and it drove him crazy. but I never ever let him touch me again. I am ashamed of all of that. I wasn't sleeping or eating and I knew something was wrong. I had a grad student in my class who worked with survivors. She said something in class one day and It just clicked that I should ask her. So I asked her to go for coffee. I told her what had happened but she had to say to me ""how many times did you say no?"" And I explained that It was 4 or 5 times. And then she asked ""How many times do you thinj you should have to say no?"" That is when I finally understood. And that was also when I understood that when I was 14, my first boyfriend also sexually assaulted me. I had always just said he had ""forced me."" But it then made sense why I wouldn't recognize someone not respecting my boundaries.That was weeks later that I figured out what had happened to me. I hadn't understood what coercion meant. He called me and I asked him how many times I had said no. And he acknowledged that I had said it several times. I didn't record him unfortunately.I tried to hold him accountable with the university for sexual harassment. But he had never written any of his comments in emails. And I included the sexual assault in my testimony. But when they found out that I flirted with him after the assault, then they turned down my case. I appealed to the university president and he also turned it down.I left grad school. I couldn't work with that man. I couldn't sit through staff meetings looking at him. My work on campus (it was an assistantship) was part of our grad studies. I couldn't afford grad school without the job.I was suicidal. But one professor stood up for me. He got me a new assistanceship in another part of campus and convinced me to return to grad school.

At a major intl conference, I (a first year TT Asst Prof) and a first-year graduate student (this was her *first* conference) were unexpectedly invited to go to a casual dinner with the luminaries (all male) of this subfield. One asked me about my research and barely let me get in a sentence before moving closer and telling me that ""if we spent a little bit more time together,"" he could make sure that my book was published. He put his arm around my shoulder and I shrugged it off and said, ""I don't know about that."" After the dinner, another scholar asked me and the grad student to come back to his room for a bottle of wine. I knew this was a bad idea and tried to indicate it to the grad student, but she was already intoxicated and wanted to go, so I was worried for her and said we'd come for one drink. Unsurprisingly, he wanted us to sit on the bed and literally rubbed the spot next to him and asked questions like, ""how far do you want to go in this field?"" He continued to try to push alcohol on the grad student, telling her ""we could all have more fun."" She was *very* drunk. He asked us if we wanted to dance. She was drunk enough that I was able to essentially drag her to her room after awhile and he was getting angry: ""we didn't even finish this bottle of wine. I could've invited other people to come up here and talk about our research, but now it's too late."" The next day at the conference, he would not look in our directions and refused to call on me for a question on a panel, even once I was the only one left.

I accidentally discovered that one of them was was on probation in another state for sexually assaulting a student.

The one who was on probation, I originally reported to the Assistant Dean because the Dean was away."male,natural,Other R1,I was stalked by a male student. He wrote papers about romantic relationships between professors and students and wrote me several emails complimenting me personally which had nothing to do with the work at hand and broke all professional boundaries.

I asked him to stop repeatedly and he didn't until I told him I would report it if he didn't stop.male,social&humanities,Elite Institution/Ivy League,"A male professor who was mentoring me began meeting with me at a local coffee shop to help me with graduate school applications. The conversations slowly moved to topics more and more personal until I found myself spending an hour listening to personal stories and details about his family and offering advice. Although these conversations began to make me feel uncomfortable, I continued meeting him once a month in order to get help with my application to graduate school. I was comforted by the fact that his wife knew about our meetings and she was also helping edit my statement of purpose, but I never met her or saw them together. I felt forced to hug him goodbye due to the personal nature of the conversations even though I didn't want to. He continued emailing me personal details about his family life and personal life, asking for advice about a potential extramarital relationship that had been developing at a different campus since he left his old position. The whole thing brought back creepy memories and I adamantly advised him against pursuing it. I suspect that the woman involved might have also been made to feel very uncomfortable."male,social&humanities,R2,"Our institution/dept was one of the bastions of queer studies and a lot of shady stuff happened with that as an alibi. Here's just one example. A tenured faculty member took graduate students out for drinks on the last day of class. He bought rounds and rounds of shots and pressured everyone to drink them. PRESSURED. My friend and I were in our first semesters of the PhD and he said that this wild overdrinking is how academia works. (Sort of right, really.) I had never been that drunk before. As the night wore on, he came up with the idea that she and I should kiss in order to get the one straight guy among us turned on. He presented this as some kind of radical act. The prof got other grad students egging us on. After a bit, we did. He made a big deal about how mesmerized the straight man was and ""probably so hard right now."" That was over a decade ago and I still feel nauseated and creepy about the fact that I went along with it. "male,natural,Other R1,"An adviser would often tell me that I was special and unlike the other students, looking at me with -- for lack of a better word -- a ""knowing"" glance and acting like I belonged at the school as a PhD student, not as a Master's student. While this was perhaps meant well, it was hard to tell because he was sitting so close to me when he said these things that it made me feel really uncomfortable. He also made personal comments about my person and my appearance that made me uncomfortable. His feedback was always very positive and encouraging, for which I am grateful, but I wondered if I was getting ""special treatment"" rather than a professional engagement with my ideas. I stopped going to his office hours and tried to avoid direct contact for fear he might try to hug me."male,applied&formal,Other Type of School,"It was widely known that a senior, tenured professor in my department would pursue new graduate students. While I was his graduate assistant, said professor had a (consensual, but since he was on all the fellowship committees, etc., still not really OK) relationship with one of my friends. As a new graduate student I did not know that this was his MO, and he had asked my friend to keep it a secret, so it was a weird and stressful year, compounded by him making inappropriate comments throughout the year. At the department holiday department, he and another one of my professors who I was chatting with started to talk about how hot they think Asian women are literally over my head (as an aside: I am short, and while it normally is not sexual harassment, men often start to talk about something else literally over my head instead of shifting positions to directly speak to each other when I'm in a group, and it is infuriating). Later on I found out that this happened basically every year or two."male,social&humanities,Other R1,"I had an internship at National History Day, which was run by two female faculty members but had other staff. I usually used the computer in the main office, as I was generally not there when the administrative assistant was. One day they had me use the computer in the office of a male colleague, who was not in the office that morning. On his computer, every time I started to type in a web address, it auto-filled with a porn site. It did not matter what letter I put in, a LIST of porn sites would come up. Porn pop-ups also kept coming up. I was supposed to be finding open source photographs for teaching materials, but it was pretty impossible.

Several women in class had endured hugs, ""goosings"", sexual comments, and innuendos from the professor, in full view of classmates; others treated it as just in fun, but many were uncomfortable. He also had a collection of suggestive pet names for some of us. He grabbed me hard once, and shook me to illustrate 'passion' in a reading passage. At least once a week he touched or made a sexual comment to one of the women. The final straw was when I was walking to class, holding hands with a boyfriend, D. The professor came up behind us, reached around me from the side, grabbed my breast and then squeezed my waist. He kept walking, D. and I stopped in shock. I am still embarrassed to admit that it was D. and not I who insisted we go to the dean of students immediately.

She was doing undergrad research in the lab of the Physics chair. Chair began touching my friend casually from the day she started working in his lab. He spent more and more time in the lab that coincided with her hours. Within a couple of months, Chair was physically trapping my friend behind lab benches and in corners. He continually made sexually suggestive comments to her. The touching advanced to 'accidental' brushes against her breasts and laying his hand on her behind. I encouraged my friend to go to the dean of physical sciences. She did. Thus began a humiliating experience with the male dean insisting that she bring in witnesses to the abuse. She did. Every one of the other students and the lab assistant were male. They witnessed many of these incidents and never interceded. Still, they did support her claims that Chair did single out my friend and most had seen him touch her inappropriately. The dean had no choice but to discipline Chair and the decision was to remove him as chair of the physics department. The dean told my friend she should avoid Chair. She had already withdrawn from working in the lab. In fact, there was no way for her to avoid Chair since he taught all of the upper level courses she needed to complete her degree. My friend changed her major to accounting and shut the door on her love of physical science. Because a man insisted on viewing a female student as a sex object, we lost a budding female physicist. We still talk about what could have been. My friend carries a great sadness."male,social&humanities,Other R1,"I was a newly hired female administrator with many years of successful administrative experience at other universities before coming to this branch campus in fall 2015. In my first few weeks, female staff and faculty flooded into my office to complain about sexual harassment. One male faculty member in particular was named but there was a small pocket of his cronies who engaged in inappropriate sexual, intimidating, and threatening comments. I reported this to HR (as did another female administrator) and over the next 2 months, several females were interviewed about their experiences. By the end of my first semester, I was able to have the main harasser reassigned to the main campus but HR said his behavior wasn_验t sexual harassment. His group of cronies immediately began their campaign to drive me out of my position. In spring semester, one of male faculty was overheard by a male student referring to me as a _岩stupid cunt_. It was reported by myself and the male student to HR but they refused to take any action; HR_验s explanation was that HR would be embroiled with the union and the harasser would claim freedom of speech. This same harasser screamed at me during a faculty meeting saying that he had more respect for rapists in prison than he did for me. During my first year, two IT department staffer (males) on this branch campus hacked my emails and confidential files supplying information to the harassers. After 7 months of my insistence that hacking was occurring, the main campus IT department was able to track the branch campus IT hackers; one was arrested and the other was fired. The university refused to investigate who was receiving the information and hacked emails/files from the staffers, but the suspicion was the faculty harassers. After 1 year, I stepped down from my position and quit (retired). The university refused to address the ongoing harassment and I feel very sorry for the females who are unable to leave and must exist in that environment. It would be some small comfort if I could believe that the university wasn_验t aware of the environment, but many female administrators are aware and, for whatever reason, will have to live with their refusal to root out the harassers.

Was very graphic and detailed in her words and I asked her to stop. As the only male in the department it made me very uncomfortable. After a few months she came into my office and closed the door saying there were ""issues"" we had to discuss. She then began to make suggestions of a sexual nature. I asked her to leave and she didn't. I got up opened my door and walked out. After that I made sure all contact and conversations were in an open area with other witnesses. Shortly after that she began interfering with my work and stated that she could get me fired. After a few months I was called into my bosses office and notified that I was ""harassing"" the employee. I tried to defend myself but I was told I could not gather any evidence nor present any witnesses and that I needed to stop my ""aggressive male tendencies"". After a few weeks the same women filed another complaint, even though I hadn't been in contact with her during the period of time. She alleged I was still harassing her and that I was saying things about her to other people. She told people that I had come on to her and that she refused my advances. After being released I learned that the same accusations had been made against at least one other employee by this person. She also complained about other people harassing her in non-sexual ways."male,natural,Other Research Agency,"My professor/mentor/thesis advisor called me one afternoon and told me that he was attracted to me. He was married -- to a former student. I told him that nothing could happen between us, but over the ensuing months he pursued me. I admired him and was flattered by his attention, and I eventually acquiesced. We had a brief love affair. When I tried to end it, he stalked me, threatened suicide, and used the pretense of an 'Independent Study' with my best friend (also a philosophy major) to get her drunk and solicit information from her about me. He eventually ended up sleeping with that friend, as well."male,NotAvailable,Other Type of School,"I am a black queer woman. Straight out of my PhD program, at my first job (an English department) I was assigned a faculty mentor who was an older tenured white straight man in the department. We had a mutual friend so I thought that was perhaps why we were paired. Two months into the job, we went to attend a film screening of our mutual friend. He drove us to the train station an hour away. He was late picking me up and when he arrived he smelled like alcohol. He told me he had had a late night partying celebrating the release of his most recent book. As we drove he behaved erratically, shouting about how beautiful the sky and trees were, sometimes not staying in the lane on the road. It became clear to me he was more than drunk, likely under the influence of another drug. Multiple times he asked me personal questions about my status as single, what bars I go to, etc. Three times he reached over and touched my thigh in the car. At one point he told me it must be hard to be a single woman at the bar because when he goes to the bar as a single man, people don't assume he's there to get laid. I was texting a fellow black woman colleague in the department about it the entire time, half laughing half scared. We parted ways once we got to the location of the film screening, but met up again at the after party. He was drinking and kept trying to get me and my friend (another black queer woman) to dance with him, grabbing and kissing our hands and pulling on our arms. My friend disclosed to me that she had met him a few times before and recalled him getting in a fight with her girlfriend at a birthday party because he would not back off aggressively flirting with her. I slept at my friend's place and traveled back with my mentor the next day. He was sober and acted like nothing strange had occurred. He even asked me some of the same professional questions he asked the day before, as if he had no memory of asking me before.At work the next week, the black woman colleague I had texted told me she was sorry, she had heard he had an alcohol and maybe drug problem before, but thought it was pure rumor. My mentor stopped speaking to me entirely, never scheduling any other meetings nor a teaching observation for me that semester (nor the following one). After a few weeks of feeling panicked about running into him and not sure who I could trust I told the director of diversity and inclusion (another black woman). She was upset and said that my department should never assigned me to him as a mentee because there was a history of known problems with him. She encouraged me to tell my chair, but I was too scared. I was in my first semester and didn_验t know who was loyal to this person, who I could trust.After no interaction (and no mentoring) with him for the rest of my first year, the chair e-mailed us both asking for a report from my mentor about our meetings and my progress in the first year. I agreed to meet my mentor for the first time in over seven months on campus during the day so I could give him some information on what I had been doing for his mentor report. He no-showed to the meeting, e-mailing after to say he had confused the time. He asked me to simply e-mail him my CV and he would write a report from that. At that time, we had just elected a new incoming chair who was a black man. I met with him shortly after this and told him in cautioned, vague terms that I had had this interaction in which he seems intoxicated or otherwise under the influence and then he stopped speaking to me or mentoring me the rest of the year. I did not mention the sexual nature of parts of that interaction. The incoming chair listened to my story and then said _岩So that_验s still a problem then. I didn_验t know._ He wouldn_验t say more, but promised to assign me a new mentor.No one followed up with me or reported what occurred to HR. The following year I tweeted at a student protest and received online racial and sexual harassment, including hate mail sent to my campus mail. My department and university provided little assistance or support. I went on the market the next year and have since left that university. They did not do an exit interview to find out why I was leaving even though I was a diversity hire and my former department has a record of losing the majority of the faculty of color it hires. My former mentor has been promoted to full professor."male,social&humanities,Elite Institution/Ivy League,"As a junior faculty member, I was always more or less ordered by the men to do things like take notes, order refreshments, reserve spaces for events --in other words, everything they considered ""female"" grunt work. When I became chair, the outgoing/previous chair (in response to a decision he was less than happy about) told me outright that he had only supported me because he had assumed that he would still run the department and I would just do all the reports and paperwork. After I became dean and the department went back to male leadership, there were two male faculty members (both married), including the chair, blatantly having sexual relationships with grad students: one ended up raping a student while she was knocked out on meds, leaving her pregnant. Already emotionally fragile, she terminated and then spent time in a psych facility trying to deal with the issues. The women themselves would not come forward because of the power pressure, but their peers came forward, both to voice their concerns and to complain about their perceptions of preferential treatment in the grad program. Both men ultimately felt that these relationships were ""justifiable"" or ""ethical"" because they ended up marrying their grad students, the most fragile of whom (the one who had been raped) gave up her graduate education, entered a marriage full of emotional and physical abuse, became a stereotypical version of the ""barefoot and pregnant"" cliche, and only recently divorced her husband (who, no surprise! was fooling around with grad students). Neither of those faculty members are still employed here, but it took forever to get a policy in place that addressed faculty/student relationship issues. On a less sexually charged front, it is still frustrating to feel virtually ""voiceless"" among otherwise decent men who are not even intentionally sexist (women can come up with a great idea and nobody ""hears"" it until a man says the same thing).

The chair of my department liked to pretend he was Jesus Christ. He had evening parties at his house on a regular basis that he invited students to, calling them his ""Disciples."" At these parties were a lot of drugs and alcohol, and predation upon female students by him and other male professors. I refused to attend any of them. I had a 4.0 GPA, including being the only one to earn an A in advanced statistics. During a meeting with various professors about how I was doing in the program, I was told by the department chair that he was 1) proud of my academic performance, but 2) disappointed he would not be able to give me a positive evaluation because I was not willing to come to his ""discipleship meetings"" (where he would hold forth, get his ego stroked, get girls drunk and have sex with them, along with other male professors.) Every other female student went along with the harassment but me, and most had sex with him and/or other professors, so I guess it really bothered him that I refused and thus I became a target. He put me on the spot in front of other professors about why I refused to ""socialize"" with him at his private home. I said some version of, ""I'm married and have other friends outside this department."" He said I was therefore not fully participating in the program. I went to my (female) advisor to complain, and she came down on me harshly, and said, ""You have to go along to get along. Don't come to me complaining when you suffer the consequences of your own actions."" I then went to my next class, taught by the professor/department chair with the Jesus complex.

I had an entire binder with me holding print-outs of all written communication with all other faculty members from over the course of the entire year that proved all of what they were saying was untrue. I sat there and took it because what they were really saying was, ""we don't want you to work here anymore."" I was the only member of the entire program faculty to have a PhD and was even a graduate of this very program--the female faculty members seemed to feel threatened by me (we were getting new department head and it later occurred to me that they felt their security depended on putting me in my place). I was offered a semester of unpaid observations so we could later revisit my continued employment. During the entire meeting, the male professor, with whom I had spoken on the phone AND in person for an average of 60 minutes/week for the entire academic year as well as had extensive email communication (documented in the aforementioned binder) repeatedly winked at me and called me ""sweetheart."" when I left."male,social&humanities,Small Liberal Arts College,"I was grabbed by a male student in a movement class (not sexually), with no advanced warning and with such force that it reactivated a previous injury and I was in pain for days.

While I know that around 10% of all sexual harassment incidents involve men as the victims, I think it is important for all to know that this happens to people of all identities.While I was in graduate school at a major, private university, one of my male, professors would regularly make physical contact with me (kissing me, sticking his tongue in my ear, etc.). He was openly flirtatious with all but would become much more aggressive in private. I felt as if I had no choice but to allow this due to his status and power over my career and, at times, I felt like it might be something that was allowing me to remain in the program. This continued even after I concluded classes as I felt like I needed him as a reference.I look back now in disgust at what he did but I fully remember the feeling that I had no choice but to submit. I think about this every day now that I'm a professor myself and wield the same power over grad students at a major university. We have to stop this."female,NotAvailable,Elite Institution/Ivy League,"When I joined my advisor's lab I quickly noticed that I was being treated differently from my other male colleagues. I was often asked to make copies, go pick up coffee, and other secretarial duties. Then it progressed to comments on my attire and long nights alone spent in his office because I required, according to my advisor, extra attention. From there, the conversations escalated to questions on my sexual preferences and needs and casual touching of the shoulder, hand, or thigh. If I avoided the conversations or tried to leave the situation I was accused of not taking my work seriously. This was the first time I reported him. I was told that to make a formal accusation would mean I would lose the time and work I had put in and would have to leave the program. We were encouraged to hug it out and work out our differences. This was fuel for the fire. After my first report things moved quickly. Soon after I was raped and felt stuck in an abusive environment.

E.g., there were fill-in-the-blank tests where I would put one answer and be marked wrong while classmates would but the same answer and get the problem right -- that happened quite a lot).

It began at a conference immediately after I had accepted the job offer. The most senior member of the area of the department I was hired into (an older man), responded to a top paper panel I was presenting on. In the midst of that panel, he not only called into question whether my research about breastfeeding was ""something women cared about"" but he also embarrassingly denigrated the top student paper (which was written by a woman of color and discussing institutional racism at her university). I publicly criticized him for his responses. Following the panel, he told me he hoped I wasn't ""one of those women"" who would ""cut off his balls""--he said this like a joke he expected me to laugh at. When I didn't laugh, he told me he almost didn't hire me because I was ""too smart and precise"" in my initial interview, but after my campus visit he thought I was ""dainty and nice."" Following these comments and into my first semester, he forcibly intervened to ""appoint"" himself my mentor in the department, made comments about my breasts and frequently referred to how much he ""could not resist women with red hair"" (I have red hair). After a meeting with other faculty members where I made a small suggestion and barely spoke, he cornered me and my department chair at a departmental party and turned to my department chair and said ""Today in our meeting she (meaning me) was a real ball buster, she sat us down and told us what to do and I was like 'heil Hitler'"" (making the gesture of the Hitler salute).

He had his name tag loosely tossed over his shoulder, so as he got closure I still couldn't tell if it was the Jason I was supposed to be meeting. He continued to tumble straight for me, I thought this must be him. He got incredibly close to me -- about two inches from my face-- and said ""hey pretty lady. You've got a pretty face."" ""Thank you?"" I replied, still unsure if this was in fact Jason and this was part of the job interview? He said ""Do you want me to kiss you?"" I said, ""no thank you"" realizing this man was clearly wasted, and not Jason.

"male,applied&formal,Regional Teaching College,"I don_验t know if this story counts as harassment, but it involves sex-related behavior in the workplace that had different consequences for the man vs the women involved. A former colleague who was a serial flirt caused drama in my department for years. He engaged in behaviors that most women would interpret as being hit on: flattering appearance, dropping by the office to chat for no reason and asking personal (but not too personal) questions, even touching that was not clearly sexual but beyond what one usually encounters in a professional setting _研 a shoulder or a wrist. That is as far as it progressed with me; I don_验t know if it went further with others. When I mentioned it to a female colleague she told me that this man was a _岩terrible flirt_ and cautioned me not to take him seriously. She told me about a woman had taken him seriously and had been badly embarrassed when her crush on him became the subject of office gossip, while the man acted befuddled and made sure everyone understood the crush was unrequited and that it was she who pursued him, not the reverse. The woman was no longer in the department when I arrived. I don_验t know her and don_验t know if the incident affected her departure. But over the next few years, I observed the man following the same pattern with new hires who were pretty young women. Others observed as well and gossiped about it, but the gossip always put the woman in a bad light while sparing the man. People would speculate about a woman_验s interest in the man, often in unflattering ways that approached slut-shaming or implied she was pathetic for not realizing this was just what he did. To my knowledge, no one ever told him to stop, but I know that on at least one occasion he was told that some women considered him flirtatious. He feigned ignorance and innocence and protested that everyone knew he was married. And then the behavior continued, for years. I doubt I am the only one who felt it was problematic but it was hard to pin down. After all, many women are attracted to men. But I don_验t think his behavior was irrelevant and I don_验t think it was innocent.

My director would not return written work to me. He insisted that I come by his apartment near the East Campus in the evening. I brought my husband, as I was wary. The professor told my husband he could not come in but instead, would have to sit out on the steps of the dark, unheated hallway. When I entered the apartment, I saw that the lights were dimmed and there was only candlelight. On the coffee table, there was was a bottle of wine and 2 wine glasses. We talked vaguely about my research paper (I was sure he had not read it). He kept inviting me to come to the back of the apartment so that we could look over his file cards together in search of sources for my project. I declined. I left. I knew he was gay (he was ""out,"" even in that era) and so I could make no sense of that evening. I knew, nevertheless, that something was very wrong. That limited discussion was the last feedback I got on my work during those two years. Whenever I turned anything in, asked for a grade or feedback, he would say that he didn't have time for office hours. Instead, I should come to his apartment. After the first semester working with him, I did go by his office to pick up my graded final (which he would not give me). Instead, he pulled out a student's course evaluation and accused me of writing it. (It wasn't mine, but I could have written that very negative evaluation of the course.) He screamed at me, told me he would ""get me"" for that evaluation. I told the DGS (a female at that time) that I was not comfortable working with this professor and that he would not return my work and refused to make office appointments. Yet I did not have the words to explain what was happening, especially because everyone knew he was gay. The DGS was dismissive and said that all advisee-director relationships were difficult and that it was up to me to make it work. When it came time for my exams, my director was still refusing to meet with me and then told me he would fail me. When a new DGS, a complete mensch, heard what was happening (my work had completely stalled, I was getting no feedback, had no direction...), everything changed.

I emailed him a few days later to tell him to stay away from me and that it had been non-consensual, rape. He has stayed away since then. I also told some of the women in his department and one male colleague right away. They were appalled and made sure that he was never again in my presence.

"male,social&humanities,Other R1,Unwanted kiss about 1984male,social&humanities,Regional Teaching College,"My advisor had a history specifically with his female students. When I started school, immediately I heard rumors about his actions in the past, how he fraternized with undergraduates in his classes, how his female graduate students continually had to endure harassment while his male graduate students did not. He would frequently take us out for drinks in the hopes of getting us drunk, at which point he would always become handsy. I remember being on a conference trip with him and several other graduate students, and we were having dinner. I was sitting at a table next to him and he leaned over and whispered in my ear that he thought my tongue was ""pretty sexy"". I was eating my dinner and I felt his hot breath move my hair next to my cheek. Repulsion doesn't begin to cover it. Another time I walked into my office, which I shared with several other graduate students, and the lights were off. When I entered the room, he walked quickly up from behind me and put himself flush against my back. Basically we were touching shoulder to knees all the way down--I felt everything. Fortunately there was an office mate of mine who had been working in the back corner in the dark (just her computer light on), and when it all happened it was right in eye sight of her. I was startled and must have made a noise because she looked up and he bolted. The worst one though wasn't physical, it was verbal. I was in a small conference room working on a talk I was about to give with a colleague from overseas that I had met only two days before. My advisor walks into the room, sees me and this other gentleman working, we're the only two in the room, and says ""oh, hello, nice quarters you have here. But then again, Sara (not my real name), knows what it's like sharing tight quarters with me, don't you, Sara."" By now the other gentleman has stopped working and looks over at me. I am frozen, I have absolutely no idea what he is talking about, I had never shared a room with him in my life. The other gentleman goes ""Uhhh, what do you mean, Steve (not his real name)?"" And my advisor goes ""Oh, Sara and I have plenty of stories we could tell. There have been plenty of times I came back to the hotel and Sara is just laying in bed naked. I always have to cover her up."" And then he just laughs like its a joke and walks out the door. I look at my newly-met colleague and try my best to assure him I have absolutely no idea what my advisor was talking about. All while feeling like I wanted to throw up, punch a wall until my fingers bled, run until my legs gave out, and cry all at the same time. It ebbed and flowed throughout my PhD. However, the conference trips were never negotiable among his graduate students, he fully expected you to attend each one with him. The pressure to do so at times was intense. I felt that if I didn't go on trips with him and take part in these ""outings"" that I wouldn't get a letter of rec, or that he'd start ignoring me in favor of his male or other female graduate students, or that he'd make the rest of my time during my degree hard. There are many, many more stories just like this with my advisor, and some other female graduate students of his may have had it worse than me. But honestly the worst part is the reputation that has followed me. Even before I came to work with him, Steve had earned a reputation regarding his female graduate students. I am in a STEM field and needless to say there have been plenty of times where I've heard ""ohhhh, you're one of Steve's grad students, huh?"" always with a smirk. It's like the four years I worked my ass off to earn my PhD was for nothing, because peers in my field think I slept my way to it.

I made it clear to him that I was not interested and that what he was doing was not okay. After such a conversation, he would be contrite and apologetic and tell me how disappointed he was in himself. I desperately wanted to believe him and restore the mentoring relationship I had thought we had.....but then, the next week a similar incident would reoccur. After I left the lab for my postdoc in another state, he sent me an inappropriately emotional email, and I clearly told him that this needed to stop, that he needed to respect his wife and that he needed to respect me and what I wanted, and that these incidents could not ever reoccur. After that, the situation changed. It became clear from our interactions at meetings that he now really disliked me and was not at all supportive. He called me just to tell me I wasn't doing well in my postdoc and claimed that other members of my PhD committee were very disappointed in me, and to tell me what a terrible advisor my postdoc advisor was (actually, he was great). When I got my first faculty position, he told me I would never be promoted (I was).

I always said no and he always pressured me. It got to the point where I was scared to stay late at work if he was around, and I locked my office door. About 9 months into our PhD, I gave in.

I consider this story one of cross-cultural relationships gone wrong coupled with feelings of isolation and depression, and I think it is very common. In retrospect, I do not consider myself a victim and him a perpetrator in the classic sense. I find it empowering to think about how I could have prevented the situation.

After the tournament, he confronted me at school yelling at me and accusing me of sleeping with a man I barely knew that he saw me speaking with in the hallway at the tournament (I did not have sex with that man btw). I had to continue traveling with him for a year to tournaments despite concerns for my own safety. I continually tried to be nice to him, but had to eventually be cold and sometimes outright angry to him publicly in an effort to protect myself and get him to leave me alone. If I showed any niceness to him he would often take that as an invitation to contact or engage with me. I suffered social consequences because our mutual friends/colleagues did not know what had happened and believed my attitude and coldness towards him was because I was being ""a bitch."" At the end of that year, I publicly posted something vague on Facebook about the situation and him, he messaged me to scold me (while also creepily saying ""you want me admit it hahaha"") and I decided to cave into his demands to remove the post. He blamed me for my own trauma and called me ""emotionally troubled"" and said this was a ""witch hunt""--at that time, I did not know how to respond, was unaware of how the pattern of abuse he had and continued to display was completely not okay, and ultimately his emotionally abusive behavior convinced me it was my fault. I removed the post and even apologized to him."male,social&humanities,Other R1,"I worked in a sociology graduate department. A professor invited me, and other graduate students, to a party. As a designated driver I was sent to get more beer. When I returned he was alone having sent everyone home. He assaulted me and while doing so talked about how he was considering failing me. I had mace but couldn_验t use it in the face of losing my whole future. I lost ten pounds the first week after. I couldn_验t go anywhere alone. I kept my mouth shut until I heard him trying to get an undergrad to meet him off campus. I reported him. The professor I worked for refused to work with me after that. Even after he admitted what he_验d done other professors would trap me on the stairs and talk To each other about how I was ruining his life. The guy running the grad program urged me to consider his career. He wasn_验t fired but had to have an escort to classes and his contract was not renewed. The faculty worked to find him a new position. I gave up my academic goals. This was in the 1990s and a Sociology Department "male,social&humanities,Small Liberal Arts College,"Throughout my career as a successful woman in higher education (Bachelor's degree, Master;s Degree, PHD, and more than 50 years as a faculty member at a major University where I was the minority woman) I NEVER experienced inappropriate advances from my male peers or students. I held them in high esteem and they reciprocated with respect and friendship. My behavior toward male (and female) associates set the tone for our relationships. These were (and are) often intense friendships but do not involve inappropriate sexual encounters."male,social&humanities,Small Liberal Arts College,"I studied and started my PhD at an Austrian university. When I started, I did not know what would be the international standards to present doctoral thesis at international conferences etc. Me and other female PhD students were held back a lot, whereas a male and politically active PhD student who started later was pushed to present at these conferences right from the beginning. This was even harder as I and other female PhDs were buried with more administrational work than the male colleagues and my PhD supervisor started to use ideas from my thesis as his. I experienced this afterwards, too, that he would do this with his other female PhD students. He would work with us intensely and if some other male professor said something against it, he started to say he never knew what we were doing and that it's bad and irrelevant. These things piled up during the PhD and afterwards he would push the new head of the department into the same direction telling that I wouldn't do interesting stuff. This person then said that someone like me cannot work in such an exotic field and he took up some ideas himself - and told me, that he expected his PostDocs to kneel in front of him as he did 20 years ago. They tried hard to get me out of my contract and when I tried to go to higher instances at the university, some people started to mutter that this might come out of a former sexual relationship that I might have stopped. Such nonesense! In the end, I got no help, so I quit my position. There were quite a few more in a similar situation, 3 quit, others worked until they reached their habilitation without any help of their male supervisor, on the contrary, many of them tried to make this way as hard as possible for them. One thing I have to add that 20 women got this tenure position to push females in university position, but it seems that especially those had the hardest time. 4 years later the new head of the university gave an order to do a study on the problems, I was interviewed and all interviewers were shocked what happened to me and most other women in this cohort. But in the end, nothing happened and the study was not even made official."male,social&humanities,Other R1,"I originally sent detailed information to the owner of this survey, but have decided to make that content public. In the last 3 years of my career at this institution, I was subjected to numerous incidents of harassment, some sexual and some violent. I will list some of those here:I interviewed for a faculty position in the same department as an internal staff candidate three times before landing the job, and that was bittersweet. In the first interview, I was told that I lacked experience. I went back to school in order to have the full credentials in case a similar position opened in the future, despite the fact that the individual hired into the job had fewer credentials than I did when she was awarded the position (she was older than I was, didn_验t have her degree, and had no teaching experience). When the position opened again, I applied and landed an interview. The day before my interview, I learned that my then-boss had been seated on the hiring committee when he called to make sure that I _岩wanted to go through with it._ He insisted that, were I to participate in the interview process, he would ensure that I was forced to discuss any job dissatisfaction publicly. He said he would make sure that I had to face him to do it, and he would not recuse himself from his vote to ensure I didn_验t get the job. I heard that I was not the committee_验s choice because I did not seem interested in the position in the interview. I was terrified of retaliation for interviewing right in front of my current supervisor. On the third opening, I interviewed and was offered the position but was told by another male member of the faculty that the male administrator in charge of the hiring decision did not want to place me in the position because I had small children. He feared I would turn it into an online-only position so that I could be at home with my children. Thus the rationale for the issues with the first two applications. When he called to offer me the job, he made it clear that I was not his first choice. They had split one position into two, and he hired his choice into the other position. She had no children and was openly lesbian.When my replacement for the position I willingly (and enthusiastically after the first interview experience) chose to leave was hired, she began to approach my office, which was next to hers, for advice. She was continuously complaining about how badly she was being treated by the staff in the new department, and I genuinely believed her and felt sorry for her. However, after several months of coming in late in the evenings to do her job for her (she also complained that no one would train her and she lied on her resume about her experience and was trying to cover it up), I had had enough. I was pregnant, and my pregnancy had been upgraded to extremely high risk so I decided to fall back to my work and my work only. The threats started immediately. She would come into my office, close the door, and tell me how she knew _岩how to get people_ because HR _岩always believes the person who files first._ She said she had made friends with the new HR director, who didn_验t know how to do her job, so this woman had kindly allowed her to borrow some of her textbooks so she could learn how HR in higher ed really worked. This meant she had a friend in the department who would believe anything she said. She told me that she couldn_验t have children, and that I was an irresponsible parent for not staying at home with mine. She told me a story about beating an ex so badly with a baseball bat that he was sent to the hospital and said she wouldn_验t hesitate to do that again if anyone _岩got in the way of her professional career._ I believed her- I actually tried to look this up in arrest records to see if there had been anything documented but couldn't find that information. I was absolutely terrified of this woman. I stopped using my office. Her staff used it as a thoroughfare (there were two doors- one into the department and one to the hallway). They would disrupt my work constantly, even in meetings with students, to open one door and walk through with their mail cart. This was an extremely tight area- the office itself was essentially a storage closet- so anyone in chairs in front of my desk had to stand up and move a chair when they were hit by the door. The staff called it their _岩easement_ and said it was their right to walk through whenever they wanted. I begged campus admin to install a lock only accessible from the inside to keep them out of my area. The request was initially denied. In that case I got the union involved, but the grievance officer told me that I _岩shouldn_验t start too much trouble because they didn_验t want to hire me in the first place._ I guess I had been warned. It took several weeks to have the lock installed, and the installation only served to further anger the people in my previous department.As the co-worker_验s behavior continued to escalate, I feared violence because things were clearly getting worse. I went to campus admin first and begged to relocate my office. The request was denied, despite ample office space on campus, and I was told to _岩stop starting trouble_ when I explained that this was due to harassment. I then went back to the union grievance officer to explain the harassment, and he told me that there was nothing in the situation that could be grieved- it was my own fault for continuing to expand my family, and I should expect that people would treat me badly because of that. He complained that we women felt _岩entitled_ to things and that we just needed to leave well enough alone. After the grievance was denied, I walked into the faculty lounge to hear him discussing my status as _岩a breeder_ with another faculty member. One commented that I must be addicted to sex because I was having so many children so closely together. At that point I knew my job was short-lived. I had no union support. I privately messaged another female faculty member through Facebook, and she confirmed that this was a pattern for this individual as he did have issues with some of the female faculty. Unfortunately most of the other female faculty worked on other campuses, so I was isolated. I had been warned in the beginning that I was not to send emails complaining to anyone- ever- and if I put anything into writing the union would see that my position was eliminated. I had nowhere to turn, and I kept my mouth shut.Shortly thereafter I was called into HR and confronted with _岩evidence_ that I had been harassing this woman. She had been filing complaints on me almost as soon as she started, as I was working long hours with her- for free- to help train her because she told a believable sob story. I was not permitted to see anything. They pulled two Facebook posts which she stated were threatening her. One post was random song lyrics to a song I was listening to while on my computer at home. They were in reference to my treatment through the union, though I did not mention this in the post, but I was presented with nothing else so beyond _岩this isn_验t about her_ there wasn_验t much of a defense. How can you even disprove that? I was told that I couldn_验t talk about the situation with anyone to build my own defense, and I couldn_验t see any of the other evidence against me. I was told that I deserved to be threatened and treated so badly. I was stunned into silence. I_验ve never been treated so cruelly, and I was 7 months pregnant at that point, told them I was high risk and the stress of it alone could be too much, and they shrugged it off. No one cared. No one. When I left the HR office I didn_验t even know they had spoken with staff- only a select few people my accuser had named and who I believe she threatened because they reported directly to her. I was told that the grievance officer had already provided evidence to the administration that I was the person being harassed and had been trying to get away from her, and that the union handled it and it would _岩all be over soon._ I went home and immediately to bed. I was so devastated, and terrified that I might lose the baby under the stress of the situation. I had two days to come up with a defense without seeing anything in the evidence file, and for those two days I was house-bound. Beyond _岩I didn_验t do this_ I really had nothing to go on. I did not know until the second day that the complaints had continued in my absence because this woman believed me to be on campus. Additional charges were filed that I was _岩bursting into tears_ in my classes and that students were coming into the department to confront the individual responsible. I had not been on campus, nor had any contact with my students. My classes were formally canceled and I had submitted sick leave, but none of that was even checked. The head of the union called me that evening, through clenched teeth, to tell me that I had _岩driven the final nail into the coffin_ of my career at that institution and that, if I did not come back to work and do the remainder of my job, the union would ensure I never worked in higher ed again. "male,social&humanities,Other R1,"I had set up a meeting with a professor to discuss doing a summer research project with him. During the meeting, he asked me inappropriate questions: whether I had a boyfriend, was he was my ""first love"", things like that. I remember feeling so uncomfortable. I don't remember him talking about his research at all. After the meeting, I told some friends, and I learned that there were all sorts of rumors about this professor and inappropriate relationships with female undergraduates."both,social&humanities,Other R1,Several female graduate students in my department were harassed by a professormale,social&humanities,Elite Institution/Ivy League,"Senior male colleague slapped my ass, in front of his wife, at a party at his own home. This 'friendly' scholar was known to do the same to others, namely another Assistant Professor, a woman of color."male,social&humanities,Elite Institution/Ivy League,"A professor in the department only mentored female, asian phd students. He would dominate their personal lives, telling them when they could and couldn't eat dinner with their husbands and not to have children. He expected them to work in his office with him alone, often late into the night. And he told his mentees to dress 'business sexy' for conferences and pre-approved their outfits. All of these behaviors were so mundane to this professor that he would behave this way publicly, in front of other faculty and students. The professor went even further with one mentee and appeared to have a physically intimate relationship with her. He was witnessed carrying her over his shoulder out of an MBA party and repeatedly sitting too close/leaning into each other's bodies/touching each other, all in ways that professional colleagues do not do. As, all of this harassment was out in the open, and easy to see for anyone caring to look, it appeared that the department and the school condoned the behavior. "male,applied&formal,Other R1,"During my PhD program, shortly after I married, my major professor brought me int a room, closed the door and informed me that since I was now married, I should no longer pursue my PhD. After that, he isolated me from the rest of my committee, informed me not to communicate with them, and then told them that I was a failure in maintaining information professional relationships. He moved to expel me from the doctoral program, and was successful, giving reasons that were false (such as claiming I did not complete requirements of my program by the deadlines). Even though I presented evidence that proved him false, to my department chair, a committee of professors, the Dean of Graduate students, etc.), I was told that I must have done something wrong and that I should move on in life. "male,classics,Elite Institution/Ivy League,"This is ultimately complicated and it is too long, detailed, and confusing for anyone to bother reading, but I need to share this because this story has ended up being one of the most traumatic events of my life and I have received no formal support or sympathy from my institution and I just need to state it publicly. When I was an associate dean at my liberal arts college several years ago we did not have formal designated Title IX officers, so several of us ended up being the staff to deal with this on an ad hoc basis. I ended up being the person that adjunct faculty and some students came to because I was in the Dean of Faculty office and dealt with curricular matters. The students who came to me had complaints primarily about other students so I moved them onto the Dean of Students, but I sometimes knew the outcome of those cases: nothing. In one case, one of our star professors (and another dean) had a son who stalked his ex-girlfriend and her boyfriend and roommates and made threats against her. The school did not intervene until he started to destroy campus property--throwing rocks and bricks through her windows while she was there, and even then it was hushed up and he was not disciplined as would be a student whose father wasn't a faculty darling. In another case, while at a campus concert, a female student had been punched and physically attacked by a male student. This male student was well connected; of course nothing happened despite the evidence she had (black eye, numerous witnesses). Most galling to me, the male student who punched her ended up being allowed to go on an international trip to country X with, for which I was the female faculty/staff member chaperoning. When I threatened to quit the trip because he was going to be allowed to go, I was reprimanded. As for the female student who had been punched, she was threatened with disciplinary action because she had been smoking pot at the concert..... The school would not support her or represent her when she took the assault to the local police and local DA. And though the DA initially wanted to pursue the case, a few weeks later he informed her there was just not enough evidence.... The worst case was the same year with two international teaching assistants on (Ms. A and Ms. B) who were being stalked and repeatedly sexually harassed by one of our longer-term adjuncts (Professor Y) who had been given informal supervisory powers over them. Professor Y was good friends Professor Z who ran the division and had seemed to be the one to suggest that Ms. A and Ms. B needed supervision because they were from traditional countries. Professor Z insisted that they could not leave campus (one was married and wanted to visit her husband on the weekends); when I told her that of course she was allowed to leave and yes she could fly back home on a Friday, Professor Z confronted me inappropriately and angrily and explained that both women were ""evil snakes under rocks, slithering, biting"" and so forth. It seemed pretty clear that Professor Z--who at that time was a friend of mine--was also involved in the harassment. I led Ms. A and Ms. B to HR and to the Dean of Students. Once we proceeded with the case, I found that Professor Z's wife, an administrator, threatened Ms. A and Ms. B with deportation; HR and the DOS were entirely doubting of these women--I sat in the meetings and was shocked at the racist, sexist, demeaning questions the female HR director asked of them as if they were too stupid to grasp American life and as if they had tried to seduce Professor Y. My dean told me I needed to stay out of it because I was going on the trip to Country X with Professor Z. I am assuming that both Ms. A an Ms. B had been told by somebody to not talk with me any further. They left campus the last day of classes and I really have no idea what happened to them. I have always felt so angry and upset that I could not do more to help them. It was the trip to Country X with Professor Z that was my undoing. This was about three months after my trying to help Ms. A and Ms. B. I had believed that Professor Z and I had been good friends for years and initially we got along well. Once in Country X, Professor Z immediately complained that certain female students on the trip were insulting him and he refused to allow them to take part in certain activities--he made me intervene and insisted he would only speak to them again if they apologized to him personally. (None of us had any idea what exactly they had done, but for the sake of the trip, I told them to just play along and apologize to him, that I knew they had done nothing intentionally wrong and that it must be a cultural miscue that we just didn't get). But everything involving gender became a problem for Professor Z. There were female and male faculty from Country X who served as our guides; Professor Z stirred up problems between them and complained formally to their university about the women. In the mean time, the male students on our trip were behaving like rude Americans. I talked to them many times but I finally blew up at them (I was highly inappropriate here, which I admitted.) At that point, Professor Z, all the all the male students, the local male faculty and staff then isolated me entirely and worse. When we got back to the US, I later found out that nearly all the students, Professor Z, and his administrator wife went to my Dean and others and attempted to have me fired. I was eventually shown the written comments the students had reported about me; I've never read more upsetting and devastating comments in my life. They were cruel beyond recognition. I was so distraught and anxious--wondering if the comments were true and how horrible I must be--that I left campus and did not return for another 16 months. Professor Z has never spoken to me since three days into the trip. It has taken me many years to realize that perhaps the strange turn against me was related to how I tried to support Ms. A and Ms. B and how I supported the female student who had been punched by the rich student who was allowed on her trip. I just don't know. It's always been a mystery to me, but completely devastating.Once in a while I hear stories from other faculty and staff that stories circulate about him sexually harassing female students and staff. But because of his politics and professional stature in his fields he is widely beloved by most other faculty and many admiring students. I have no idea what happened to the women in Country X he attempted to get fired, but I have never been able to get over all of this and what a central role he ended up having in the Title IX sorts of cases I was involved with that year. He was somehow always intertwined, but here he remains. I now suspect that the reason he and his wife came to our campus from a far more prestigious institution is that he may have behaved inappropriately before. "male,social&humanities,Elite Institution/Ivy League,"It was the summer before the second year of my MA. I had come home from my graduate institution, and I was in touch with my favorite professor from undergraduate. He had just retired, and he told me that he was getting rid of a lot of his books, so he was sort of holding a giveaway event at his house. A lot of these books were materials I would need on my upcoming master's exam, so I was eager to get what I could so that I didn't have to dip into my stipend to pay for these materials or lug them to and from the library. I was under the impression that other former students of his would be coming in and out of his house that day as well. When I went over, I was the only one there. Fine, maybe I was just in an off period and missed the other students coming. He made me some tea, and we spent a little bit of time catching up before we went back to his library to sort through some books. I had my reading list with me, and I took what I needed. Finally, when I was done, I wanted to start loading up the books in my car so that I could go home - I was living with my parents for the summer, and I was eager to get home so that I could make dinner.That's when things got weird. The professor didn't want me to leave his house; he tried to get me to sit longer with him, he tried to put me in a reclining armchair and lay it all the way back. When I protested and told him that I needed to go home because traffic would get bad and my parents were expecting me, he replied, ""What? You want to get home so that you can hang out with your MOMMY?"" He was 70 and I was 25. He was old enough to be my grandpa. His face contorted and got ugly, and he grabbed my arm and tried to hold me down. I'm not entirely sure how I got out. Nothing aside from that happened, but the adrenaline kicked in - I knew that if I didn't get out of that house now, I was probably going to be raped. I don't remember what I said, but it was enough for him to let me out of the house. I also left with the books. I did use some of them on the exam, but most I haven't touched. They're still sitting in my garage because I can't look at them without immediately being sent back to that armchair, eyes wide, fearing what was going to happen next. This was a professor who used to be my favorite, who was my undergrad thesis advisor, who had been a recommender of mine, who I had kept in touch with all those years as a mentor, but nothing more. He did email me after this and asked me out, but in my response I lied about having a boyfriend and made comments that pointed out how old he was. He left me alone after that. I'm planning on going through all those books and getting rid of every single one over the winter break so that I don't have to be reminded of his face anymore when I see them sitting in my garage. I'm very lucky that I got out of situation. It was scary, and I can't imagine what it would have done to me if I had gone any further than it did. "male,social&humanities,Elite Institution/Ivy League,"I heard from the other students that my professor was telling certain grad students in the lab how handsome they were and taking photos of them on her phone. I saw it happen one time. The men didn't mind. I found out later that my supervisor gave one of them a large bonus for a task similar to something I had also performed. However, I was rejected when I asked for a bonus. To make things worse, my supervisor's husband is a senior staff scientist in the lab. He is in charge of most of the young women in the lab. My supervisor thought it was funny that most of the women in the lab work with her husband and most of the men in the lab work with her. I heard that her husband pesters the young women about their love and sex lives. He says inappropriate things like asking a female grad student to treat him like her gynecologist. I caught him joking about how young women, naming one of the undergraduate women in particular, should take drugs and have as much sex as they can while they are young - this was in the middle of the day in the lab, surrounded by male postdocs. I told him I would report him to HR if he didn't stop. But he thought I was joking and laughed."male,social&humanities,Other R1,"This is gender harassment, not sexual harassment, but it speaks to the climate that does not take women seriously as professional and intellectual persons.When I arrived on my liberal arts campus over twenty years ago, I was one of the very first tenure-track professors to work on gender and sexuality. My own department has always been extremely supportive (after all, they chose me out of a pool of more than 400 candidates!). But I was surprised, having taught at other institutions, how cold other faculty were to me, and how few students I had. At the end of my first year, the conservative student newspaper published an expose of my department--gasp! all FIVE of us were registered democrats and could we be trusted?--but there was also a little satire about the problems my department had hiring, including a satire of me (unnamed) that I had done my dissertation on menstruation and what sort of evidence could possibly exist for that? (I did not do my dissertation on menstruation by the way, but reproduction.) I was confused, upset, and went to my dept. chair. He knocked on the other colleagues doors and said ""it's time to let her know what has happened."" We all met and the chair grabbed a big, giant file and said if I wanted to see it I could. Apparently a year earlier--when I gave my job talk--faculty in another department found my work so threatening (!) that they went to trustees and some number of them (I've never looked at the file) went to the president to try to get my job offer rescinded or buy out my three-year contract. The dean at the time was intertwined in all of this, and suddenly my inability the year before to get a contract out of him for months made sense. It also made sense how on the phone he told me things like ""I'm not sure we'll find an office for you; I'm not sure whether we can provide moving expenses."" There was no campus housing available for me (I was moving across the country)--I am the only faculty member in all these years who was not offered campus housing as far as I know. It made sense why I was paid in the high 30s, and how my salary remained in the 50s well into the 2000s. The thing was this story never seemed to go away. The story that the student paper had run about me got picked up in national conservative sources, including a college guide (that used the satirical material)--three years later, the director of PR got up at a faculty meeting boasting about how fantastic it was that our campus had such a great write up. For years, students would come tell me how their professors in another department joked about me and students would tell me how there was a joke that as I was doing book revisions, maybe they should put used tampons on my door for my research, etc. Despite the fact that my book and articles have ended up winning prizes, that I have earned all sorts of professional accomplishments outside my field, etc. I remain marginalized on my campus. I do get along with my colleagues--including some of the ones who were most hostile to me when I have arrived--and so I believe I am respected as a congenial, easy-going, hard-working colleague and I am a very popular professor among students, but my work on gender, sexuality, etc. is itself dismissed and not of interest to the academic community here. This is not sexual harassment, but it is part of a larger institutional problem where anything that has to do with gender, sexuality, and power is not considered as important as other fields and topics.

I was 25; he was 45. I kept telling him I just wanted to be friends, and he seemed to get it, but then he'd show up at my apartment with flowers and champagne. Although I wouldn't let him touch me, and never indicated I wanted more than friendship, he wanted to formally ""declare"" our imagined romance to the department. He'd decided I was going to be his next (3rd) wife. Finally, I told him to leave me alone, and he responded, ""you have no idea how much power you wield over other people."" Ugh.

I ran into him months later at the campus library. He said he'd been checking by my carrel to see if I was there. I hadn't told anyone where my carrel was. We got on the elevator, and once inside he pinned me against the side and tried to forcibly kiss and grope me. I was choking him but couldn't get him off me. He stopped when the doors opened and I was able to get away. "female,social&humanities,Other R1,"Is this harassment? Just before and after I finished my PhD, this academic celebrity from my PhD institution (not in my department but a related field) began pursuing me romantically, despite the fact I was married and he was in a long-term relationship. I suppose I responded positively to some of his attention because I was super stressed out in my first year in a tenure-track job, which was causing depression, anxiety, and mania; I was isolated; and I had gotten very little mentoring on my scholarship in my PhD program. He read my work and praised it. It felt so great finally to get recognition for my ideas. And he seemed interested in my thoughts on his work--or at least he pretended to be. It was all long-distance, so it was not physical, but I did become emotionally attached to him. He emailed and called *relentlessly* with increasingly sexually charged messages. When I felt overwhelmed and tried to stop contact, he pleaded with me to continue. I was not emotionally strong enough to stop. Then, after several months, he suddenly dropped me, pretended like he had never done anything, and accused me of only liking him because he was famous. I guess this is not technically harassment, because I participated to a certain extent, but now, looking back 15 years later, it was certainly an abuse of power. He was a celebrity, I was vulnerable, and he played me. It's a little Clinton-Lewinsky-ish. "male,social&humanities,Small Liberal Arts College,"Myself, and a number of women in my graduate program, were subject to sexually explicit jokes and commentary from a male faculty member. I was shown graphic sexual imagery. I was called sexist and derogatory terms, e.g. ""bitch.""

I was a little surprised as I was a nobody PhD student, and he is considered the father of an academic subfield, but grateful for the opportunity to have someone of his stature look at my work and possibly give me feedback and guidance. He is not from the university I was at, at that time. Three distinct occurrences:1. He traveled to the city I lived in for something, and suggested we meet for a coffee. I didn't see anything wrong with this. Coffee and snacks were without incident, but then he suggested we take a walk to the nearby park as it was such a nice day. I agreed. As we walked there, he reached out to take my hand. I was shocked. He held if for a little while, and then I pretended I needed something from my handbag and disengaged my hand. After that I made sure to have my handbag on the side between us so he couldn't hold my hand again. We sad on the grass in the park where he lay down and opened a few of his shirt buttons.2. During a separate conversation, or maybe during a conversation when he was in my city, he told me about how his wife and him went to nude beaches. 3. At AoIR in Denver, I ran into him near the escalators and we were chatting and catching up. A young Southeast Asian woman was coming up the escalator and he stopped in mid-sentence and said something like, ""Oh wow I need to get to know *her*!"" in a creepy desperate sexual way. I was just staring at him, and he suddenly realized where he was, looked at me and said, ""You didn't hear or see any of that."" And then he walked off."female,NotAvailable,Elite Institution/Ivy League,"I was sexually assaulted by my MA thesis/former diss. chair in 1995, just after my second year in grad school. Forced to perform oral sex in my advisor's offices as well as in offices he had given to me and other graduate students working on his grants. Worst time occurred in an office he had assigned to a fellow graduate student. I was so ashamed that I begged to be taken elsewhere. My advisor took me to his car and continued this enforced oral sex on the roof of a campus parking structure. I again begged to go elsewhere. My advisor then drove around the roads right around campus, forcing me to continue oral sex while we drove, until we almost got into an accident. He then dropped me off at my church choir rehearsal. I felt paralyzed and unable to move. My arm wouldn't work to open the door. It was as if I had had a stroke. This was repeated multiple times in the enusing year (the year I was ostensibly getting ready for my qualifying exams) when he would drive me home. Once he drove me to a remote canyon and forced me to do the same. Two times this practice was nearly stopped by others (by an old lady with a flashlight and a police officer who rapped on the window) but I did not resist. I dissociated instead. My abuser called these events a ""cancer on our relationship"" and tried (successfully for many years) to convince me that this was my doing."male,NotAvailable,Other R1,"Professors in the music department ganged up on a transgender professor and drove her away from the department. As part of that, they (including the department head) targeted a student of hers who had a disability and invented extra tests the student had to pass in order to obtain her degree, which was designed to aggravate her disability. Other students did not have to do these tests, and the tests were unusual at that stage of her degree anyway, which was a writing and research-based stage. The student was eventually forced to take a lesser degree and she also had immigration problems as she was on a student visa, which limited her ability to use legal mechanisms to protest. At the same time these events were happening, one of the professors in the department (who did not participate in the bullying of the disabled student) was dating and eventually married his own student. There was also a rape outside the music building in about 2011-2014, which is poorly lit with lots of bushes, and students often leave the building after dark when practicing. A male grad student approached the department head (who bullied the student with the disability and the transgender professor) and proposed improved lighting and clearing the bushes. He was rebuffed and cost was the reason. The male student then proposed the students perform a benefit concert to do this. The male student was then forbidden from putting on the concert."male,social&humanities,Small Liberal Arts College,"It was the early 2000s. I was still very young, just turned 21.

Eventually we were very drunk one night when he put his arms around me and suggested we go to bed. Feeling like this man had been the souce of my entire self esteem for 10 yrs, I agreed. He waited until I was maked in his arms, then rejected me. I could deal with that - it was consensual ane I fully believe ppl should be allowed to change their mind during sex - but he then ghosted me. Totally froze me out of his life when I thought we were friends. I thought the explanation must be that he never thought I was any good academically and that he only wanted me for my body.

I agreed, reluctantly, and he proceeded to feed me enough booze to floor any sensible person. After the conversation had become slurred, he held my foot with a coy smile and said he liked my socks.

When he subsequently began to flirt with me, I was beyond flattered. His charisma blinded me to the power imbalances that made the notion of consent between us problematic. This imbalance only intensified once I followed him to his department and became his advisee. He knew that he was the only faculty who had overlapping interests with mine, and that I based my decision upon my understanding that our relationship would become more professional by necessity. He only stood by this promise for two weeks before requesting oral sex (that surprised me by being unreciprocated). A few days later he notified me that he had had a change of heart and that our relationship would need to become strictly professional. He listed a number of reasons behind this decision, such as the negative consequences that would befall me if anyone were to find out. Lurking behind these seemingly concerned words was a clear threat: he would continue a professional and supportive relationship with me IF I KEPT QUIET. This threat was obscured by his insistence that I had power too, that if his family found out they would leave him. I didn_验t realize he was my abuser, my captor, until a year and a half later, when I called a crisis hotline to get help with my self-diagnosed Stockholm Syndrome.This happened two weeks into my PhD program. He continued to function as my teacher and my mentor, but he withdrew the warmth that I had come to depend on, within an otherwise hostile department. I was worried that he would lose professional interest in me now that sex was off the table. I obsessed over ways to get that warmth back, to rekindle his interest in me. I spent copious amounts of my mental energy on my appearance on days that I would see him, reasoning that it was in my professional interest if he thought I was pretty. I found myself in uncharted emotional territories that consumed me for years. He is still my adviser."male,social&humanities,Other R1,"A senior professor who led a large research group hugged a series of women inappropriately and routinely made inappropriate comments to women members of the research group. His creepiness was the subject of frequent jokes among undergraduates working with the professor. On several occasions I heard rumors of serious inappropriate behaviors. My understanding was that the behavior was recurring across many years. This professor knew the name of every female in his group, no matter how junior, but rarely remembered or payed attention to any of the male students, no matter how senior. As a male in the group, this was welcome at the time, and I felt I could skate through the experience protected by his disinterest in me. Nonetheless, even I felt deeply uncomfortable in the professor's presence."male,social&humanities,Other R1,"I know of an incident involving a female graduate student, and a male assistant professor.

She left the program."male,social&humanities,Other R1,"Fall 2015. In a phone advising session this person became angry/frustrated that I wouldn't apply to the graduate programs he demanded. I told him it was because of a bad graduate experience in the discipline and I wanted something more theoretically rigorous. He told me I as like a ""17 year old girl that got dumped by her first boyfriend and decided she was a lesbian."" I stopped speaking on the call. It wasn't the first time he'd been domineering and attempted to control my decisions in our advising calls (we never met in person). I didn't say anything else on the call except to mumble affirmations, wait for the call to end, and I never spoke to him again. He emailed me back from his @gmail account and wrote a brief apology for being short with me, which he attributed to overwork. "male,social&humanities,R2,"A few years ago I was introduced to a senior academic, twenty years older than myself, in an interdisciplinary field closely allied with my own. My four-year contract at the R1 university in town had just ended with no prospect of renewal and no hope of being turned into a permanent position. I was a single mother of a toddler about to go on Employment Insurance. The senior academic works at a nearby university and is the head of an important research institute. He is very well-connected and is well-known for helping young academics in their careers. A mutual friend connected us through email and the senior academic looked up my web site at the university and read about my work, quickly inviting me to an academic party at his house. When I met him he was very interested in my work and asked to see my latest project. After reading my work he admitted, somewhat grudgingly, that I was a good writer and didn't need his help with the article. He asked if I would submit it to a journal he is affiliated with. I did so and the paper went out for review. Shortly thereafter he invited me over to talk about the paper, which I thought was odd as it had already gone through the submission process and was under review. He asked me to dinner at his house, where he expected me to do some of the cooking because he didn't know how. After dinner he asked me, quite openly and with no innuendo, whether I would enter into a sexual relationship with him in exchange for career mentoring. I was horrified but merely said I was not ready to enter another relationship so soon after my divorce (which was true). Although my paper, which had already gone out for double blind review, was published, I understand that he now gives very mediocre reviews when asked about my work. He has asked me out on more than one occasion since that time and appears to keep tabs on my status. I recently had to ask a friend to pose as my boyfriend at academic events that the senior academic is likely to be at. After the first such time the senior academic questioned me very closely about the nature of my ""relationship"" and whether it was serious and whether my ""boyfriend"" was local and what he did and so on. He hasn't bothered me since that time, but I no longer get invites to academic events at his research institution, and thus an important networking opportunity is lost to me - although given the way he has sabotaged my connections since I turned him down, perhaps this isn't a bad thing."male,NotAvailable,Elite Institution/Ivy League,"Upon arrival for summer fieldwork in a foreign country, my graduate advisor insisted that we share a hotel room with a single bed, and spent the night attempting (without success) to get me to declare my love for him and to sleep together (I insisted on sleeping alone on the floor). His inappropriate comments, touching, asking me to ""at least"" give him a piece of my unwashed laundry to sleep with, etc. continued, despite my firm refusals, for the remaining weeks of the project, and all I clung to was the hope that the relationship would become purely professional again when we returned from the field (and to our respective fiances). Things did seem better back home during the fall semester, but in the winter he and his fiance broke up, and the inappropriate emails and invitations resumed. He even began forwarding me email conversations between himself and an undergraduate who he had insisted on taking on dates after she had come to his office asking for a letter of recommendation (he had spelled out all the details in the emails). I can only imagine that he was trying to show me the kind of grand romance that ""I was missing out on,"" or something yucky of the sort. Ultimately, my refusals to meet privately with him escalated to him threatening to give me a bad annual review and have me thrown out of the program. I next went to the (then) department chair, director of graduate studies, and a female professor, to ask for help, and was repeatedly turned away. I finally reported him to the Title IX office, and things only got worse from there. I turned over all of the emails and a list of willing witnesses, and the ""investigation"" dragged on for almost a year (during which I was forbidden to speak about it, but continued to be slandered within the department) before the Title IX office issued a report stating that some of his ill-advised behaviors ""may have led [me] to feel that [I] was being harassed,"" but they concluded that I actually was not. The report was also worded in such a way that it painted me in a very negative light."male,applied&formal,Elite Institution/Ivy League,"I literally just saw his obituary on facebook. This isn't even my story to tell, but seeing his face - and reading the comments of all of these people who think he was so great - I am just so angry. So here is the story that isn't mine: My closest friend, another woman sociologist who is a gender scholar, was recruited by a top gender scholar (male) in his 70s (she was in her early 30s and untenured) to meet with him to discuss whether or not she wanted to co-author a textbook with him at a conference. She was exited about the meeting - which happened at the ASA conference - but I got a panicked text from her a few hours later asking me to come meet her in the lobby of our hotel because he was trying to convince her to come to his hotel room to sleep with him. I joined, along with a woman who is a well-respected senior scholar, and the four of us had drinks and chatted for 30-40 minutes and I was shocked and sickened to notice that this guy didn't back of for even a minute. He was continuously trying to touch my friend's leg, and began stroking her arm at one point (she seemed absolutely frozen), and didn't seem the least bit concerned the this actions were inappropriate. He was married but told my friend the marriage was loveless and that he could ""be in love with"" my friend, and would she give him a chance. It was disgusting. It was also clear to me that he had offered her a co-editorship on this textbook and was dangling it in front of my friend while simultaneously begging her to spend the night with him. My friend grew up in a fairly working-class family and has always struggled with imposter syndrome and the fear that she won't make it as a scholar.... she was the perfect victim for this type of disgusting manipulation. So it was the 4 of us having drinks in a hotel lobby, and my goal, in coordination with the woman senior scholar who was with me, was to stay at the table until this man gave up and went to bed. It never fucking happened. Eventually it was last call, and I saw my friend's face, knew she was panicking (to be clear, in her world it would have been impossible to assertively tell him to back off), so we all rode up the elevator together to make sure he didn't get off at her floor. He, of course, didn't hit the button for his own floor, so the senior woman asked ""what is your floor?"" and hit the button FOR him, and said ""Goodnight! It was great spending time with you!"" and more or less pushed him out of the door. My friend was horrified and humiliated. She vacillated between wanting to report him to, well, anybody (in fact there is no clear place to report misconduct of this sort), and wanting to email him to apologize for not sleeping with him. She never did get that co-authorship on the textbook. TODAY I found out that he died a few days ago. I found out because some of his former students posted his obituary on facebook, saying so many nice things about him. It made me furious. I wanted to post something on facebook, telling these women - many who are absolutely amazing feminist gender scholars - that this man they thought of with kind memories was a creepy shameless predator who has to this day made my friend wonder if he was ever interested in her for her work, and if, maybe, somehow, there was a way she could have handled things to avoid the harassment but still be given the opportunity to co-author. I'm furious. I'm glad he's dead. I just wish this was MY story to tell instead of my friend's, so I could take him down and destroy his memory. But, then again, he never would have chosen me to harass in this way because he chose his victims carefully, and my friend was incredibly vulnerable. Like I said, I'm glad he's dead."male,social&humanities,Small Liberal Arts College,"For the duration of my doctoral program, my advisor crossed professional boundaries, culminating in her telling me I was mentally ill and that she worried I would off myself like so many other talented young women she'd known. She subtly (and not-so-subtly) made negative comments about other women in our field whose work I enjoyed or admired; she always had a story about how this one was a bitch or she'd heard that one say a weird thing once. A fellow doctoral student once told me privately that she'd behaved in a way that made the student worry she was hitting on him (both prof and student were each married), but I felt alarmed and uncomfortable and brushed it off, saying I was sure she didn't mean it that way (I wasn't sure, and I am so sorry I didn't hear him out. He could have been trying to tell me something worse). I never saw her as a mentor, but I had no other choiceto chair my dissertation committee--she was the only full-time faculty in my field. We were generally cordial with one another. In the final year of my degree, she amped up the abuse cycle of intense negging (about me, my work) and intense praise, sometimes delivering both in the same day. She told a fellow grad student that she feared running into me (her graduating advisee!) because things were ""so weird between us."" I became anxious even to check my email, fearing what new epic screed I might find from her. And finally, weeks before I was set to defend my dissertation, I opened one where she claimed that she feared for my mental health because she believed I was in the grip of a psychotic break and, further, I was in no position to be a member of any faculty (I was on the job market.... as was she). I still feel sick thinking about how that message might have been received by someone who was severely depressed or suicidal. When I forwarded the message to the dept chair and our graduate advisors, the chair made a comment that made it clear my advisor had been bad-mouthing me and painting me as unhinged or untrustworthy. I realized her email wasn't the product of a bad day/semester/stress on the job but the culmination of her interfering with my progress towards my degree in the months before I was set to complete it. (Un?)relatedly, two female Masters advisees of hers (one a first-year, one set to graduate as well) dropped out of the program the same year the harassment from my advisor culminated.

I cherished them as friends and mentors. The ""chair"" of my shadow committee was a man who is about 20 years my senior and was 4 or 5 years ahead of me in the program. He was a self-described feminist who was well known for his somewhat radical sexual ethics.In the summer of my first year, both my ""shadow chair"" and I were going to be in Europe. We made a plan to meet up and spend several days being tourists together. The night before he flew over (my flight was a few days later) he confessed that he was deeply attracted to me and wanted to pursue a sexual relationship. I was stunned and said ,""thank you for telling me."" The next time I saw him was in Europe. I felt scared and uncertain; like I could either lose him as a friend and mentor or, somehow, part of me.

One that sticks out was at a national conference when a peer and I were invited to a hotel party with several people I trusted. When I arrived, there were about 10 people in the hotel room, including four senior male researchers in my field. It seemed innocent enough at first, but after being offered a glass of whiskey, one of the senior males grabbed my foot and wouldn't let go. Suddenly, another one of the males was having sex with a former graduate student in the middle of the room.

When I arrived in London, in our very first meeting he pulled out champagne, sat very close to me and when we said goodbye he insisted on hugging me and putting his hand on my butt. This continues throughout the year every time we met for class on a weekly basis, he would ask that I stay behind to talk to me in front of the other students and then would touch me always on the ass again when saying goodbye. He asked me a few times to meet him after hours in the being on weekends which I said I was unable to do. This lasted about 1 full year, from the first to the last time he touched me. I had no idea what to do and so pretended it didn't happen and eventually came up with a story that I was a very religious and gained about 20 pounds on purpose to make myself less attractive.

The two women most likely to supervise my work were obviously having their own struggles: one had a four year old and complained to me that she couldn't get away for conferences. She saw me as a sympathetic ear when I went to a Kathy Acker conference, rather than someone she would want to champion. The other, though established, obviously didnt get institutional respect and was not terribly active nor current. Mid-MA, a new hire came back to his hometown where I was studying. I was stunned how much the work he was doing around class and urbanism overlapped with the digressive research I had begun during a seminar paper on Ulysses. I found out he founded the poetry collective which was the primary draw to me studying in this region. I was a bit overwhelmed by all of this consonance. It seemed mutual (I thought, lol) and we began to work together. It was all independent because for some reason he wasn't teaching graduate classes right away. During this time I began to write about art. Of course, coincidentally, he wrote about art too. I began seeing him around at art functions & got a variously flirty and disparaging vibe. I thought he was a wonderful candidate for friend-supervisor-contermporary. His relationship to academia and being a prof was obviously troubled (by his working class roots/Marxism?). There was obviously some mutual magnetism, but what began to happen is this: He began to check out my chest during meetings. He neglected to pay any attention to my work or progress. He seemed really struck when I changed my hair from curly to straight. I finally got him into a meeting about my work and he asked if I had taken my ideas from an architect we mutually knew. He eventually titled an essay loosely based on the concept/metaphor I had created (the one he thought I was fed by the architect). I thought it was my fault for slightly crushing on him. But I have to wonder: WHAT MALE GRAD STUDENT DOESNT BRING HIS BASIC DRIVE INTO HIT GRADUATE WORK? And what male supervisor who decides to champion him isn't in some ways responding to that? I decide to write about art ""instead"" of pursuing academia. I see this person at conferences still (I am still academic adjacent though my writing and I adjunct). The vibe is just as weird. Never respect. Never inquiry about my work. He is friend with my friends but doesn't see me as worthy? "male,social&humanities,Other R1,"A fellow PhD student in my department has a history of routinely making weird sexually charged comments to other students (women), especially when he doesn't have a girlfriend. Many of them are weirdly intrusive implied questions about their partners or sex lives. My least favorite of his comments at least partially directed at me came during our first semester of graduate school when he sat between me and another then-first-year PhD student, a woman, in the back of a large van on the way to a site for a class field trip. He and the other PhD student were discussing the efficacy of the flu vaccine, which I found annoying, so I mostly was trying to ignore them. Then the conversation shifted to other vaccines, and more people got involved, including master's students sitting in front of us. Eventually the HPV vaccine came up, and he said something along the lines of, ""Well, you only need that if you're sexually active, and I'm sure none of the ladies in this van would do anything like that."" We all just sort of shut up and stared at him; the master's student directly in front of him (Indian Canadian) just shook her head once at him in disgust at his behavior. I think he knew by then that the PhD student sitting on his other side lived with her boyfriend, and a lot of his own behavior made it clear that he was no sexual neophyte, so it's not like he genuinely believed what he had said and thought he was complimenting our purity. He knew he was making us uncomfortable; I'm not sure if he actually thought anyone would take the bait and start spilling our sexual histories or if just making us uncomfortable was all he meant to achieve. Of course we were stuck in the van with him for awhile longer; I squished harder to the side and went back to staring out the window. Sometime soon after, I made some passing comment about how creepy he was to my older labmates, both women, and they pulled me into their office, shut the door, and went off with their own stories about him and what they'd heard from other people. We considered asking our advisor to talk to the student, knowing that our male advisor considered himself a feminist, and that this student respected our advisor and needed him on his committee. I decided I would try to confront him myself first. I ended up doing it really softly; in an email about something else class-related I concluded by asking that he refrain from making sexual comments, because it made me uncomfortable. He did stop around me, and for awhile, I thought I had done something. I have since heard ongoing rumors of continued such behavior and worse, particularly when he is a TA helping lead overnight field trips of mostly master's students, and everyone shares a house and drinks; I've heard of him taking a woman's phone and texting her boyfriend , ongoing gross mouthing off, and other dumb but really not OK stuff. As a first-year, I had thought that he was a sexual harassment lawsuit waiting to happen, and that his bad behavior needed to be shut down then in part for his own good, before he got into real trouble, but now, as a somewhat more jaded fifth-year, I wonder if he'll just keep getting away with it, and get worse, but perhaps better at knowing what he needs to hide, as he continues to progress up the ranks. Science-wise, there's no reason he won't progress. I almost feel a little irresponsible for having confronted him myself about his behavior towards me and stopping it that way, instead of reporting him to an authority figure, because now I don't have solid grounds to do anything to stop him from becoming the sort of deeply embedded predator that frightens women away from our field and worse."female,social&humanities,Other R1,"At the American Astronomical Society meeting last year, a senior male approached me and asked me if I was married or had any children.

For example, our department designated a few grad students each semester to be _岩Grad Representatives_ at the Faculty meetings (we were to take notes, send these along to our grad student collages and be the official voice that would represent the grad student concerns and opinions to the faculty in the faculty meetings). When I was a grad rep, this man would sit next to me and rub my thigh the whole meeting (I didn_验t sit at the conference table as it could only seat some of the faculty, the rest sat in chairs around the room, and I sat in one of these chairs as well _研 which is to say his behavior was not under a table, or anything, but out in the open among his colleages and my professors). He did this to the other grad rep (also a female grad student) as well when she attended meetings, and to the grad reps other semesters too. I now realize that we were in a room with more than 20 faculty in a top R1 department, and no one ever ever commented on it, even in private. It is true that our department had (and still has) very few women faculty (at the time maybe 10% of faculty were women; there were more women than men grad students, however). The behavior of this chair was treated as sort of a running joke in the department.

I will share two of the most impactful incidences. My professor once sent me a message with my photo, indicating that he had just finished pleasuring himself to it. He also once grabbed my wrist in an empty hallway, in an attempt to pull me into a bathroom. I quickly pulled my arm away and ran into my other department's office, where I cried asked another professor what I should do (I was a double-major at the time). "male,natural,Other R1,"I was a grad student at a small liberal arts university in Colorado. I studied Tibetan Language and Buddhist Studies and decided to do a language immersion in Tibet in the summer of 2006. I chose a program through UVA and Columbia that a few of my friends had done years prior. It was the summer the railroad was completed. The director of the program was an adjunct faculty member at Columbia. He and I had email contact prior to the program. I had thought I might not be able to raise enough money to go and his response to that fact via email was mean and shaming and I remember the email having the tone of _岩you are screwing everything up for everybody._ I felt horrible. And last minute, got the money, which was a few thousand dollars, I believe. So I could go.When I got to Chengdu, I found out immediately that the Chinese government were not issuing student visas at all because of fears of protest related to the railroad opening. Everyone in the program knew this because there were emails about it. But I had not received any of those emails. I was kept out of the loop. So suddenly I was in Chengdu for who knows how long before we figured out how to get into Lhasa. I was kind of rapidly processing a very different program all at once. We also would not have access to the usual University professors the program generally worked with because of the same protest fears, etc. So we all tried to figure out what to do with our time and many of us decided to travel to Eastern Tibet by car. The director of the program offered to let us all keep our bags in his room as we traveled. A kind gesture that I think we all took him up on.I went one morning, I think the morning we were heading out. I had wanted to be on better terms with him as the only contact I really had to that point were the mean emails. So we sat in his room about 10 minutes and talked. I told him about my studies, about a non profit I worked for, about this and that. I got up to leave and he opened his arms to hug which did not bother me. I was happy we were on more congenial terms and I am a hugger. So this was normal to me. I hugged him and in a split second he pulled me tightly, put his hand on my ass, his tongue in my ear. I hardly had the time to take in what was happening but it was happening so fast. I pushed him from me and he pulled me back this time his tongue trying for my mouth. I pushed again and mustered a _岩no._And something that I always remember so vividly was saying as I walked toward the door was, _岩thanks for letting me store my bag_ as I left. This reflex to remain polite and to pacify in spite of the fact that I felt disoriented and creeped out. And I remember how my mind was working fast. He was the leader of the program, the only authority of the situation. I didn_验t know what I needed from him exactly but I knew I relied on him for plenty of things. I went to the street and used a payphone to call my then boyfriend/now husband to cry. It was a tremendously groundless and strange feeling. And the director was utterly oblivious. He ended up being the only teacher for the program, so I had to theoretically learn Tibetan from him everyday for weeks from that point onward, which proved to be impossible.

At one point, after going to the bathroom, she came back without her top off and being super sexually agressive. The next day she appologized, claimed to have no memory of what happened, but she stopped working with me, talked bad about me to senior scholars in the field, convinced another of my committee members to step down from my committee, and set-up the conditions by which I had little support in a department that was super toxic, so I ended up working with an advisor who was not sexually abusive but was toxic and volitile in other ways but was the only one in the department that believed me and was willing to sheild me from the first professor. I never reported it because the I didn't want to bring down the racialized violence of the University.

I felt like it was one of those things you just had to put up with, just part of ""being a woman"" in the world.

My (male) boss tried to walk out of a 'rehabilitation meeting' (to get back to work effectively) to avoid taking responsibility for the situation. Eventually, I left the department (physically by changing offices, though my PhD is still fully connected to the department) to prevent remaining in a constant state of hyper arousal and hyper vigilance and to find peace enough to work and regain my sanity.

I documented the comments and took them to the Dean, who said he would talk with the inappropriate associate professor. I did not get the impression that he cared and do not know the outcome. I did not notice any difference in the associate professor's behavior, other than hostility toward me.

The first, when I was in my first year as a graduate student, there was a more senior grad student in my program (he was a 3rd year student, if I recall correctly) who made it a habit to grab the asses of women graduate students. I was groped at least 3 times by him, once during class. Another woman graduate student in my program reported him, although I do not know the outcome of this. However, I do know that he went on, within the same organization, to become a postdoc, and is now a research assistant professor there. The second incident occurred when I was a postdoc at another institution. I was attending a Gordon Research Conference, which was held at a boarding school; the conference was very insular, and prettymuch no contact with the outside world for the week. I observed multiple instances of older, established male professors - leaders in the field - speaking and behaving inappropriately with woman trainees and early-career professors, mostly during the evening dinners/recreation. On the last night a dance was held, and I was dancing with a few of the other women.

After that suspension was due, the university started an investigation, which was completed in August this year. Unfortunately, Dr. X has been suspended again still without any pay or permission given to contact his students since August this year.

So then, he SUED ME for defamation. Fortunately, I found a law firm to represent me pro-bono, and they got the lawsuit dismissed.

His demeanor, facial expression, and voice intonation clearly signaled that he relished the idea of committing physical harm to me, much as a sadist would. The entire night I felt his eyes following me, and I became very afraid. I made certain to leave with a group of other students, and I never participated in a recruiting weekend again.

All this in front of many colleagues during a lovely discussion; I don't know if anyone noticed but no one said anything.

""No."" ""So, ..."" and then the dirty joke. I'm not a prude. I just didn't want to hear them from him. Here's a typical story: once we had a visiting speaker (female) and at lunch we were talking about a female member of our field and he said, ""She has a phallic vita."" We said, huh? He said, ""Long and strong."" Meeting with him: ""Do you mind if I close the door? Don't worry, I won't sexually harass you."" I also heard it non-stop from our female students.

As well as being a CEO and has a lot of money, she uses her new company as a way to talk about her good deeds in supporting women and female entrepreneurs. It sounds like she's supporting good causes, but having met her I see it's a key part of her ego.

She asked for a glass of wine, I was 20 at the time, so didn't really know much about wine. It was 5pm - but all we had was coffee and water. We were talking about her company and the courses I was taking and what I planned to do. She told me she was a big fan of young talent. The conversation became more personal with her asking me how she looked - she looked like my mom who has a corporate job but I didn't think she'd like it if I said that to her. She then asked me if I felt the ""boys"" in the audience would find her attractive - I said I didn't know. She then asked me if I thought she was sexy. I knew from her bio how old she was and that she had a husband and a lot of kids from a previous marriage and a new one, so I didn't know what to say. She sat down next to me and put her hand on my leg and said what about now. She moved her hand up and grabbed me through my jeans. She laughed and said something mean. She then grabbed my hand and put it on her breast... she said I better be nice to her or she would tell my professor that I had touched her. I could feel myself going bright red and I could feel puke in the back of my throat. Someone made a sound outside the lounge and she jumped up. She told me not to say anything and may be I would be lucky at the end of the evening. She told me if I said anything she would get me kicked out and make it impossible for me to work in the city - my whole family lives here and so I was planning to stay. I had told her this earlier.

Mid-sentence, he leaned in and kissed me (tongue and all). I pushed him off and explained that I am not interested, I am in a relationship, etc. He persisted in trying to kiss me, so I got up to leave. He offered to walk me to my hotel.

I asked if I could speak to him in person because I wanted to ask him to back off and he accused me of making an advance on him. After I chewed him out for the accusation, he apologized and said he would pay more attention to his behavior, but if anything, it got worse. He combined his behavior with compliments and very kind behavior as well, and in hindsight I honestly feel that he manipulated my feelings because I let it go on for so long and even genuinely began to believe he had honest romantic feelings toward me. But when I confronted him about things again later on, he claimed that it was all in my head. I have since found out that he has done the same thing to other women in the department, even after they have told him, in very specific terms, what he can and can't do if he doesn't want his behavior to be construed as flirting or a romantic advance. This was a person I looked to for advice and mentorship because he's ahead of me in the program and very successful. I have no case against him as far as the university is concerned because the behavior was not explicitly ""sexual"" and because I maintained a friendship with him for so long (that even at one point did evolve into some confused romantic feelings on my part), but it was inappropriate, it was gender-based, I feel manipulated and preyed upon, and it has been significantly detrimental to my mental and emotional well-being."both,social&humanities,"More Than One Institution (feel free to elaborate in ""Comments"")","In my third year of BA, almost immediately after my first supervision with my dissertation supervisor (Lecturer), he text me to ask if I wanted to meet in a hotel.

I did hear him during the night come out of his tent (we all had tents pretty close together), and I heard him walk over to my tent (I was freaking out, wondering how I survive this, because yelling and waking people up would just result in ME having trouble because I know he would say that I asked him in or some other lie and that no matter what choice I made, I would be the one to suffer). Luckily, he stopped just outside of my tent, and I heard him piss right next to my tent in the night. But then he went back to his tent. It was awful. During the time of all these actions (over a year), this professor was sleeping with an undergraduate that he picked up over the previous summer from the field camp he taught. We, as graduate students, all knew about this. At a conference meeting, the opening night this professor came over to me and told me this long sob story of how his wife was leaving him (she had found out about the affair) and how he had cancer. He didn't say what kind of cancer but he alluded to it having something to do with his genitals. I was supposed to feel sorry for him. When I told my friends (other graduate students) we put two and two together and decided that he probably caught some VD from the student he was sleeping with and didn't bother to tell his doctor and thus he really didn't have cancer but had VD. But!! Several times during these months, he also told me that if I didn't sleep with him, he would make sure that I never got a job (I was just months from graduating with my Ph.D.). To avoid this, whenever I applied for jobs, I did NOT put him down as a reference. At some of my interviews, people would ask why his name wasn't there, since he had been my MS advisor and they expected a letter from him. I was able to get out of the situation because I could tell them that he had cancer, and thus I didn't want to put an additional load on him by having him write me letters. Whew. Saved by his lie. (BTW, the issue of cancer never came up again from him, so we all assume that he actually never did have cancer). I was finally able to get a job and LEAVE. I have had to avoid him for my entire career and I still feel bad that he probably has other victims out there and if things had been different, could I have done something to have prevented some of those? I'll never know. "male,social&humanities,R2,"As an undergraduate student, and one of only a VERY few females, our 'group' of geology majors would study together often in the evenings as well as take classes together during the days. It was not uncommon to be the only woman in a room, or during most classes. Many times, one of my fellow male students would, when the professor stepped out of the room, take his penis out of his pants and push it up against me from behind or on my arm or shoulder (or wherever he could). He would also do this at night. The other men would cheer. It was imperative upon me, if I wanted to be included in the group, to laugh it off and 'just be one of the guys'. I had to laugh off a lot of harassment. "male,applied&formal,R2,"A group of us graduate students were out at a local bar across from our University on a Friday night. We were there to mostly get free food during happy hour. As usual, there were more male grad students than female in the group, but I was not the only female student. A group of 4 male professors sat at a table next to us and you could see that they were talking about us - pointing, particularly at me, and talking. I had recently won an award, so I wondered if perhaps they were talking about that. (duh, in hindsight, pretty stupid of me to think they cared about my brain or scientific expertise). Finally they came to some kind of agreement and decided which one of them would come talk to us. They shook hands and one of them came over to join us. He made a lot of small talk and was really nice to us, and as graduate students we were all flattered that this professor wanted to hang out with us. Everyone in the group thought this was great when he said he wanted to go with us to the next place. He offered to give us (several of us, not just me) a ride to the next bar to help us be safer and have a designated driver. We already had one or two others doing this too, so we all just went out to the parking lot to jump in the cars of the designated drivers, and go to the next place. When we got out to the cars, it ended up that I was the only person left who needed a ride, so I ended up in his car. (in hindsight I think he planned it this way) Instead of driving me to the next bar where all my friends went, he insisted on stopping off at his house first, and he insisted that I come in with him. I was too trusting, because I didn't know this person very well but, he was a professor, so I should trust him right? He acted like it was fine. So I went inside with him, and stood in the kitchen waiting for him to get whatever it was he needed to pick up. He came in the kitchen, and grabbed my sunglasses off the top of my head, saying something to the effect that I didn't need those while inside. He set them back off to the side in the kitchen and I thought how strange that was, since putting them so far back there is very likely going to result me forgetting them when I leave. So I made a point to remember that they were there. I thought that was so weird because we were only supposed to be there for a minute while he picked something up. He insisted on getting me a glass of water, so I took it and started to drink it. He then went into his bedroom, telling me that it was his bedroom (some door off the living room - I think it was only a 1 bedroom house) also thinking why does he need to tell me that room is his bedroom? I don't care, just get what you need and let's go, my friends are waiting. Then he came back into the kitchen, and he threw me against the wall, hard, and kissed me roughly. He was trying to push me into the bedroom and telling me that I wanted it, that I must want it otherwise I would have never come into his house. I was completely shocked and not ready for any of this, but I fought back, very hard, and turns out I was pretty strong. I also screamed NO at him and I essentially threw him across the small room in my anger. His back and head smashed against the kitchen cabinets. He then tried furiously to keep my sunglasses, which I am 99% certain, was going to be his way of ""proving"" he 'had' me or whatever bet those 4 professors made when they were at their table staring at us and shook hands on. I had to physically fight him for the sunglasses and rip them out of his hands. I think I was still screaming at him too. I then ran out the door. I had to walk, a very, very, long way, home. crying. There is no doubt in my mind, that had I been less strong or had I not reacted so violently towards him, I would have been raped that night.

I'm sharing this story because it was consequential in terms of my pursuit of graduate school, as well as how I respond to cases of academic dishonesty as a professor. I was an undergrad in NE Ohio with anticipation of applying to my school's graduate program. Over the course of the semester in my stats class, a classmate constantly pressured me to help him study. Miscommunications, combined with my not wanting to hurt his feelings, led to a never-ending night of trying to fend off his aggressive advances that literally left over 15 dark bruises from my torso to my neck. I left his dorm in the early morning, and when I left he asked if I would leave my homework assignment and told me that he would return it before class that day. I left the assignment, but he was late to class and turned in both of our assignments to the professor at the end of class. The professor publicly reprimanded us for plagiarism and we were not given credit for the assignment. I was mortified. I never explained the incident to the professor and he never asked about it. I do believe that the incident is the reason why the prof ignored my follow-up inquiries about a project he had previously invited me to become involved with. I also wondered if the story of academic dishonesty circulated among other faculty within the department.

So, I'm not sure this is exactly what you are looking for. I was propositioned by 2 of the men's basketball coaches, one of which was the head coach. The incident with the head coach was at a athletic department function that was held at a bar. Near the end of the evening, he came up close behind me while I waited to order a drink and whispered into my ear, ""What's your favorite position?"". I tried to laugh it off and give an half answer as to not offend him, but then he offered me ride home. I ignored that question and waited for him to be distracted - and when he finally was, I left the event without saying goodbye to anyone. The second occurrence in the same athletic department was after I lost my brother tragically. I was invited to lunch by another coach that had also had a family tragedy in his past. At some point over lunch, I was informed that if I ever needed to be with someone, sexually, he was available. He went on to normalize this discussion by saying everyone should have sex at least once a week and that it didn't need to be more than that. I was numb from the pain of losing my brother, so this wasn't as shocking as maybe it should have been. I didn't take him up on his offer, either. I told my boyfriend about both of these incidents, but he was a graduate student as well and we both knew that making the basketball coaches upset could put us at risk. They were both really nice people and that is hard to reconcile. I had to continue to work with both of them, in limited ways, and socialize with them at department functions, and neither ever brought up me declining their offers. I do have to say though, these instances were taking into consideration when I decided to change careers and no longer pursue my dream of being a collegiate coach. I didn't feel threatened but I didn't want to be in an environment where this type of behavior was accepted and, in a way, expected. This occurred at the highest level and I still feel guilt about what I didn't say to ensure others felt comfortable at work. This wasn't a big deal to me, I have years of experience of finding a way to turn down men without making them feel bad for approaching me. But, for those that are more vulnerable, they shouldn't have to feel this pressure. And honestly, I shouldn't have to think about the men's feelings when I say no. I should just be allowed to say no and go on about my business.

After a public talk, I went up to the (famous - and, I later learned, married) speaker (whom I had never met before) to ask a question. After a short conversation he took my hand and said something along the lines of ""you will be at the reception won't you."" I said I would be and went home for the hour before the reception, deeply disturbed by the look in his eyes and the way he held my hand. I debated about what to do all hour long, and I felt sick. But he was/is very famous, and working on a topic I cared deeply about, and I wanted to know more about his research, and so I attended the reception, at the department head's house, where he took my hand again and barely let go all evening. It was horrifying but I felt paralyzed. I didn't feel like I could make a fuss about it in front of the rest of the department, and a part of me thought that perhaps if he liked me so much he would be more willing to talk about his research by email after he left town, and that that would help me (and I think part of me also thought that perhaps my star would rise in the department because of my colleagues seeing this). He asked if he could see videos of my research the next day and I agreed - once again with a sick feeling in the pit of my stomach, but also the sense that this could help me get ahead. At this point I have to say that I had had childhood experience of being fondled in return for favors, and I believe (and literature confirms) that that experience led somehow to predators recognizing that I might be amenable to this behavior (I wonder how many of us who have been the victims of academic predators in adulthood have had similar childhood experiences - NOT an excuse in any way for the predators, of course, but rather an observation that all kinds of predative behavior exists, and has deeply destructive consequences). I have spent decades working this out of my system. The next day we watched the videos in my (windowless) lab, and he kept his hand on my knee throughout. At this point I finally told him that I was not interested in that kind of interaction, and he said that was fine, but that he enjoyed my company as well as my research, and that we should try to collaborate. We did write a (successful) grant proposal together and so I lived through several years of a hand on my knee and, as time went on, a question about whether I was interested in more.

Not only were there stupid and childish homophobic jokes and generally stupid male banter between the two senior males, but the French archaeologist also proceeded to talk in a disgusting and sexist manner about the local indigenous women in Church who we had seen on the weekend, discussing their body parts and how he would like to have sex with them (in a much more vulgar manner). All of this was in front of three younger female field assistants who came to me later in a panic- they had never experienced this sort of behavior before (being sexually harassed), one put it this way- that she had never felt so uncomfortable but at the same time that she had no power to say anything to ask the behavior to stop. I decided I had to confront my co-PI and tell him that this French researcher would no longer be invited into the field to work with me as he was sexually harassing the female students. My co-Pi (remember this is my former dissertation chair) blamed the whole incident on me- I was told that yes, this French archaeologist was a sexist but that I just had to deal with it, and moreover, I had been ""pushing his buttons"" so whatever had happened was my fault.

My co-Pi had let female US students smoke pot and drink alcohol with other males on the crew and other local (foreign) male workers.

My co-PI let this female student go fishing, alone in a boat, with a male field worker (foreign) who then sexually assaulted her and threatened her life numerous times. Once the assault was reported by the student it was reported to the local police. My co-PI did everything he could to keep the story under wraps and out of foreign newspapers and US papers so as to save his own reputation.

(My research, service, and teaching were all better than his.) Ultimately this cost me tenure. I know about this because after I was denied tenure -- after being voted up by the Division, faculty evaluation committee, and dean -- the prof in question started harassing a technician who had worked with me and was a good acquaintance. Prof repeatedly told the tech that the tech was having gay sex with me (we were not; we are both straight white men, the tech is married to a woman), continually bullied the tech, made lewd sexual gestures and sounds of the tech engaging in oral sex, would not let the tech avoid this harassment, referred to the tech as the prof in question's ""nigger"", his ""bitch"", and said there was nothing the tech could do about the prof treating him like this. Eventually this affected the technician's health. I knew about none of these events at the time, but the tech sued the college (Title IX) and this information all came out. By then it was well past any window where I could appeal tenure (there is only a 2-week window to announce an appeal at that college). The college settled with the technician out of court in exchange for a non-disclosure agreement from the tech, which the tech has honoured, and the prof in question was stripped of his status as Program Chair. The prof counter-sued and won on procedural grounds. Or maybe the college settled. You can look up the result, it's online. While this was going on the prof in question started following the tech's wife, who works on campus, and blocked her ability to drive off campus at one point. Those actions led to the local police enacting a restraining order on the prof in question. The tech got a high school teaching job and left the college. I was denied tenure and moved twice for other jobs. The irony is that I barely spoke to the prof in question; why he petitioned the president against me is anyone's guess. He had a reputation for being unstable (which was clearly true), and I gave him a lot of room. The prof in question has been the subject of first-amendment websites, which claim he was wronged, despite his actions arguably ruining the careers of two dedicated employees at the college."male,social&humanities,Other R1,"FYI: My example is an outlier as it has to do with a colleague harassing me after I transitioned from male to female. I don't want to distract from the other stories but be a supplement to them by providing an example that likely has some parallel others with regard to the negative effect dealing with the harassment has had on me and my career.After earning tenure, I transitioned from male to female. What I experienced was sexual harassment in the form of purposeful mis-gendering of me by a colleague in my department. I kept trying to get him to stop by personal interventions as I had no desire to ""out"" myself to any more people at the university which would happen if I made a formal complaint. However after 5 years of it I finally filed a formal complaint. When I finally did make the complaint, an ally in the department remarked at how patient I had been with the perpetrator. This is when things got much worse. The dean, chair, and the Human Rights people did their best to address the complaint but the perpetrator stymied them as much as he could which was very stressful to me as his office was next to mine and we had to work in the same department during the investigation. The uncertainty of when the investigation would finish along with not knowing if it would be in my favor was extremely distracting. It was also very worrying as if he was found non-guilty then he would basically have carte blanche to keep doing what he had been doing.Things got much worse when the perpetrator appealed the decision of the human rights office investigation that he be removed from the department. The perpetrator hired a lawyer and I had to read extremely transphobic statements about me in their prepared rebuttal statement. The appeal was also drawn out with me now having to make a statement to the appeals board to defend myself. The worrying about the appeal being granted and my perpetrator being let back into my department caused even more distraction and depression.During the appeal process I learned the one of my colleagues (a woman full prof) was testifying on my perpetrator's behalf and that one of the appeals board members was obviously hostile to me.Eventually the original finding was upheld but I still lost due to all of the worry and distraction that caused major depression which also severely affected my professional efforts.

Another student from the same cohort tried to argue with me about women being too sensitive, and then later would walk into my office at various times during the day to ask if we were enemies. One professor would talk shit about his wife in class and how she didn't have a real degree because it was in Women's Studies. She made more money than him and was at a different University.

Another professor was unbelievably racist and sexist, grabbed asses, touched women, talked about how his students were fat or sexually appealing, offered to have sex with people's wives in class, etc. I was not willing to work with one professor because I had been involved with his title IX case, our chair, a woman, told me to just ""pretend nothing ever happened.""

I announced it to her and the rest of the lab at a meeting and she growled and said, ""oh my God, I'm going to shoot you."" She laughed, but no one else did.

I told a female PhD program professor about it a couple of months after it happened and she seemed to understand, but did not provide me any support nor did she tell me that as an administrator of a different program within the same department, she was tasked per university policy to report him. She didn't report him, and she did not speak up when he ended up on my comps grading committee at the last minute. I failed my comps - something I blame on his participation in my grading, my dealing with the death of my father, my dealing with a department that did not support me after his death and did not care I was so bothered by what my harasser did and the fact that I just couldn't prepare as I should have with all that baggage. After telling a fellow student about this and avoiding my harasser as much as possible (e.g. not being in a room alone with him, not raising my hand in his class, seeking out the associate head of the program when I needed something), I reported him to the university's EOC. They told me I let too much time pass to file a formal complaint and that I should be lucky it wasn't as bad as other instances they knew about on campus. I then went to the Office of Faculty Affairs about it and was told I should learn to avoid him when I needed to be in the building. I became so anxious about coming to work and felt so depressed over the death of my father and how I felt alone in a city and at a university that had no interest in my success. I started to drink more and go out more - anything to take my mind off the environment I was in. I finally reported him to who I thought was my mentor and asked him not to tell anyone but to just help me overcome this issue. He took it upon himself to report it to the dept chair who then told my harasser I was causing a problem for him. When I asked why my name had to be brought up, the dept chair said while he didn't have to tell my harasser who was causing a problem for him, he felt it was the right thing to do so he could face his accuser. Of course this caused further hardship for me because it seemed as if they were protecting him, not supporting me. My mentor began referring to me by Ms. (my last name) instead of just my first name like he usually did. He sat with me and the female PhD professor I first told about the harassment for one hour one time under the guise because I asked them to please help me pass my comps, but when I let on how frustrated I was and got tears in my eyes, the female professor made a face, implied I had mental problems, and asked if I needed to leave the room to get myself together. I took my comps twice more and failed out of the program. I wrote a lengthy letter to the university president and received a response that said her office reached out to the dept and that a ""counter-narrative emerged from those conversations, supported in some cases with rather compelling documentation. I have no doubt that you were sorely disappointed in your experience in the department and really do wish it had been otherwise. However, your failing out of the program was also very disappointing to those in the department who sincerely believe they attempted to work with and support you to the extent that they could. It was, in essence, a mutually disappointing experience for all concerned. I asked the department to think seriously about what they might have done differently to facilitate a more positive outcome. I ask you to do the same."" Because I failed out of the program, I lost my job and my health insurance. I had to rely on the other adjunct teaching jobs I had to work to pay my bills and on unemployment for a while. I left teaching as soon as I found the first full-time job that hired me. I left my research interests behind, I left students behind, etc. That part was probably for the best. If what I experienced is what academia is, I don't belong there. And maybe I just didn't have what it takes to cut it in a PhD program - that I can accept. But it would've been nice to find that out based solely on my lack of success, not on being harassed, having to hide in hallways to avoid my harasser, being a part of a university that did not care about my success or my well-being and being in a culture that dismissed me and so fiercely protected my harasser. "male,social&humanities,Other Type of School,"When I was a graduate student, an older male assistant professor (who had recently been a fellow graduate student in our department) asked me to co-edit a volume of essays with him. As we started working on this, he wanted to skype and text and talk all the time- not just about the project. Before this we were sort of friends, but not close (did not hang out outside of school). I saw red flags, but I also wanted the publication. I let it go on way too long. When conversations got awkward, I just went along with it. He would call me belittling names, and I let him. I am so ashamed and embarrassed. As things escalated, I started to be honest and confront the situation. It devolved from there. Our meetings got worse-- he would cry, freak out, call me names. He started making decisions about the book behind my back, belittling me and my contributions. I tried to confide in one of the contributors (male, also a former graduate student from our program). He believed me, but did nothing. I ended up just walking away from the project and all the work I'd done, only to have him stalk me for a whole year after this. I now carry mace with me at our annual conference, and I'm always looking over my shoulder. I can't go to our department's reception, and I avoid walking around and going to other panels out of fear. "male,social&humanities,Other Type of School,"First year as a tenure-line Assistant Prof, a senior male colleague texted me almost every weekend to have beer with him and his male friends. I never accepted the invitation, and no other faculty member in the department received this invite. Second year as an Assistant Prof, the same male colleague began texting me various types of dick pics as well as Bristol Stool charts describing his bowel movements. Also during my second year, a female master's student came to see me during my office hours. Upon meeting with this male colleague to express her interest in pursuing a PhD, he asked her why she wanted a PhD and why she didn't just return to her home state to be someone's ""bitch."" The student was visibly shaken and looking for advice. She decided not to enter the PhD program at this university. During my third year, the senior male colleague videoed - unbeknownst to her - an inebriated female Assistant Professor kissing someone. The male colleague offered to send me the video, and I declined his offer. I believe he shared the video with other male colleagues. Since my third year, I have had resources removed from me, program administration assigned to me (really, dumped on me), and have had my merit pay negatively impacted. The new department chair, who is also male, is good friends with this particular colleague. Finally, I have had other colleagues approach me with concern about inappropriate language this male colleague has supposedly used in emails to female students. "male,social&humanities,Regional Teaching College,"I had a job interview for a tenure track position. My first after getting my PhD. The Chair took me out to lunch, had three scotches, put his hand up my skirt and laid it on my upper thigh under the table, gave it a squeeze, and asked me if I wanted the job. I was frozen and could only squeak out, yes. I experienced incest as a child and I think that early experience, along with cultural norms, made me unprepared for what happened at the job interview. I taught in a very male field (film history as well as film production, directing, camera) and men hated having a woman teach them. My male students constantly made films where women characters were raped, mutilated, and killed. Or films where they masterbated for the camera. They would project their films and then watch for my reaction. That, too, was sexual harassment. I got no support from the male faculty to help me deal with this classroom atmosphere. "male,social&humanities,Other R1,"In 2012, just as I was beginning to explore my options for graduate school, the Honors Program director took me under her wing, She presented herself as an academic mentor, and she also hired me as a teaching assistant and student office worker. Over three months, she began to schedule meetings over lunch and dinner, began to write handwritten letters sent to my home, and pursuing long text message exchanges. At first these were work-focused, but gradually she began expressing dissatisfaction in her marriage and making suggestive comments about me. Eventually, this escalated to direct, forward comments imagining a sexual relationship with me. When I tried to deflect these comments by explaining that I was gay, she began to push harder, trying to _岩convert_ me, and pressuring me to divulge details of my love and sex life, explaining that she had an appreciation for homosexual erotica. On one occasion she demanded I bring some files to her home, and when I did, she forced me into her bedroom and would not let me leave until I sat down on the bed. When I demanded an end to contact, she threatened to out me and blamed me, claiming that she believed I had been leading her on."male,social&humanities,Other R1,"A group of grads went on a week field trip driving to Mexico with a professor, who was graduate director at that time, about a decade ago.

He turned on the pay for porn. He slept naked. Incredible that he thought that that would work, but I guess that's how sexual predators think. He married one of the other grads, less than half his age, and they had a kid together.

The final was oral. Because I scheduled late, I knew that everyone else had a casual chat and that it was a pleasant experience. My final was entirely different.

"male,social&humanities,R2,"This happened when I was still a graduate student. I was asked by my advisor to help host a visiting scholar from a university outside the U.S. After some conversation, that visiting scholar mentioned that there was a postdoc available at his university. I was still in the my second year of graduate school, but I asked about the postdoc, such as what is its title and how would I apply? That person verbatim told me, ""you get to know me"". I did not say anything. Afterwards, he kept leaving me notes on my apartment door and asking me to hang out with him. I declined and avoided answering the door. Years later, I saw him again at a small conference. I had just made it public that I was engaged. That scholar's vibe became weird (because I was engaged?) and he left the conference early but right before leaving, he grabbed and kissed me. (I never did apply for that postdoc)."male,social&humanities,Other R1,"This was just the worst of, and by, many. The year was mid-2000s. I had known this person for several years during and after graduate school. I drove him home one night after dinner, he invited me to get a book, and once in his apartment, began trying to kiss me. This was a complete shock; he'd never pulled anything like this with me. I pushed him away several times on my way to the door. However, before I reached the door, he was able to grab me and hold me down long enough to shove his hand down the back of my skirt and under my tights to shove a finger up my ass."both,social&humanities,Other R1,"In the first year I went on the job market, still ABD, my dissertation director sexually propositioned me, out of the blue and while his wife was out-of-town.

This caused a great deal of difficulty in the class, because the rest of us felt that she was getting special treatment because she was pretty. We were inclined to blame her for being flirtatious. At the same time she was very disturbed by it and made a point of not being alone with him. This (married) prof had a reputation for hitting on female students but always ""waited to be asked""; was rumoured to have had several affairs with students (his wife had been a former student, but also others, both before and after my time). This introduced sexual competition into an environment in which we should have been judged for intellectual activity only.He also had a favourite undergraduate student, admittedly brilliant, who spent hours alone in his office with him and flaunted this to everyone else; again causing other students to feel as if we had to compete for his attention through sexual attractions rather than through intellectual prowess. And this element of sexual competition introduced rivalry where it should not have been. So, for example, I didn't like either of these students simply because they got his (sexualized) attention. This should not have been an issue. They were not the problem. He was the problem.And here I want to mention an issue that I'm not sure if others have mentioned. Partly because I knew he was ""available"", I had a huge crush on him. I did nothing about it, and avoided him as much as I could because I was ashamed of how I felt. It felt like my fault; that I was the one was sexualizing the environment by having a crush on him. And I think that female students, in particular, tend to often have crushes on male profs; and it is the prof's job - because he's the one with the power - to downplay that, ignore it, and desexualize the environment as much as they can (which, obviously, he didn't.) But I felt as if I was to blame. And I was jealous as hell of the students he was paying that kind of attention to. Was I not pretty enough? Was I not smart enough? This complicated grad school. And I should say: this paragraph was hard to write. I am still ashamed of myself and still blame myself. Perhaps rightly. I finished my degree 25 years ago. "male,social&humanities,Other R1,A senior co-worker pressured me to date himfemale,social&humanities,Other R1,"Mine is a 1990 hostile environment case: a pattern of animus and obstruction of degree completion that I--but not a similarly-situated male colleague--experienced. The male colleague and I had nearly identical committees (including the same dissertation chair) and were at the same stage, i.e., ready for defense and graduation. One of our reading committee members, TL, withheld his signature so that I could not set a final defense date and insisted on reviewing my statistical analyses in detail; however, TL allowed the male colleague to set a defense date (August 3) with no prior review of his statistical analyses. During June-July 1990, I endured four 2-3 hour meetings with TL reviewing statistical printouts (at one point, taking a phone call and asking the [unknown] caller whether they thought my analysis strategy was ""stupid""). TL demanded that I conduct analysis and put them in the dissertation; then at the next meeting, he'd insist I take them out. Another committee member (CL) who held a joint appointment in the statistics department had no concerns with either my analysis strategy or findings. I reached a breaking point in late July, when another faculty member intervened with my dissertation chair, who evidently talked TL into allowing me to set a defense date. The defense date (August 16) required me to change my travel plans (I'd accepted a job 2300 miles away and was flying out to begin teaching in late August). My defense ran nearly three hours (most other students' defenses were less than two hours), and when the committee called me back into the room, TL said (twice) ""Congratulations, Dr. [name of male colleague]."" TL demanded additional changes that required me to register and pay for fall quarter tuition, and when I sent them he delayed reviewing the final document so long that I feared I'd have to fly back for a second defense (the university required another defense if the final document was submitted after more than 60 days). In the end, it cost me $1500+, a gigantic hit to my self-esteem, and an incredibly stressful start to my new job. About 6-7 years later, he pulled the same routine with another female student who asked him to chair her committee.

When we got back to her apartment, I almost immediately fell asleep on a blow-up mattress in the living room. The next morning, I woke up to someone brushing his hand up and down the side of my body. It was my instructor. He called me several times a day for a week or so, asking me out. Each time I let the call go to voicemail. Other than with my friends in the apartment, I have never spoken about this incident because I've been incredibly ashamed and embarrassed, thinking that may be it was something I did that let him think it was okay to lay down next to me.

"male,social&humanities,Other R1,"December 1990. I had graduated from my B.A. in French, and was in France for a year. My advisor invited me to meet him and his wife for coffee one evening. Because I had babysat their two children through my undergraduate studies, I thought it was a lovely gesture, and agreed to meet them. The venue changed from a coffee house to a bar--again, not a problem, because I knew them well. I arrived, and my advisor was in his car smoking a joint, and beckoned to me to get in the car with him. He said that his wife couldn't make it, and asked if I wanted to go see a particularly gawdy Christmas light display with him nearby. He started the car, and drove toward it, then parked. He grabbed my hand and shoved it between his legs, and pulled me close. I was so stunned, I didn't know what to do, but pulled away while he told me of his stress getting tenure, then having terrible reviews from his graduate students the semester before. He kept talking, then drove back to the bar. We went inside, and I tried to act as though nothing was strange, then left quickly after finishing a beer.I was upset, but thought he was high and would forget about a lapse in judgement. I did go to graduate school, and was forced to take a sparsely attended rhetoric class that he was teaching, because ***'s class was full. It was a topic I loved, but throughout the class, my professor continued to harass me, suggesting first that my paper was brilliant (but only gave me a B+), and offered to help me in his library carrel. I didn't go. He gave me information about a conference, and told me that I should submit a paper there. I hesitated, and he called me one night, asking me if I was going, so he would be sure to go, too. I didn't submit a proposal--even though it would have been a great opportunity for a first semester master's student. I avoided him for the rest of my studies, and did well. I was given a paid position assisting the editor of a major journal, and the graduate advisor asked me to stay for my PhD. Unfortunately, my professor presented a question on my master's exam that I could never have anticipated--it had nothing to do with my studies, and did not allow me to demonstrate what I did know, and so far from what other students were given that I was blown away. I knew a little--it was related to a French psychologist--and tried to answer, but was absolutely devastated, and sat in the exam sobbing for two hours before trying to write--about two pages, actually--then leaving. All the events in the car, and for that semester, came back to me, and I realized that he wanted me gone.In my orals, the department head sat beside me, and reassured me as I talked about the other questions. The question from my harasser did not come up once, and I tried to mention it (had become nearly an expert by the time of those exams!), but the committee kept switching the topic, and then said that the question was ""unusual"". The harassing professor did not say much at all that day, which was very unlike him. The following week, the graduate advisor told me that he was ashamed of my written exam, and told me that I was not allowed to return. I did, however, pass my master's exam. I really felt that they wanted to get rid of me quickly and quietly.I am incredibly grateful, in particular, to one professor, who believed me. He was excluded from my exam process because they scheduled the exam while he was on an extended trip to Brazil. He told me that he felt this had been intentional. He was extremely well regarded (***'s biographer, among other things), so it meant a lot to me that he tried to help me. "male,social&humanities,Other R1,"I was a postdoc in a genetics lab. Two male graduate students would frequently berate the female undergraduate students for things like their weight and relationships. One of the undergraduates remained in the lab after her graduation. The professor who ran the lab and she were involved in an inappropriate relationship, and the woman was fired, apparently when the professor's wife found out about the relationship. The incident was not common knowledge, but was known to another female graduate student in the lab whose was close friends with the woman. I found out when the professor himself confessed to me a few years later. He justified his behavior because he said I knew he was not treated well at home by his wife."male,NotAvailable,Other R1,"After becoming his research assistant during my first semester of grad school I found out that he had a lengthy reputation for propositioning female grad students. I had already noticed some odd behaviors: he often closed the door (or asked me to close it) if I was working in the office with him but left the door open if he was working alone; he frequently had the lights off when I worked with him as well. I would turn the lights on whenever I entered (he never said anything and I hoped it established a boundary). He frequently invited me to ""see his house"" after work. I'd always respond by saying that I'd check to see if my then-boyfriend, now husband, was free to join us. He would quickly change the subject. He had also published an autobiography of sorts, which he suggested I read. In it he recounted some of his past sexual escapades, which was quite uncomfortable. It's been 10 years since I worked for him. I no longer remember the details. I know there were many times that I was made to feel uncomfortable. I had to be on my guard constantly. I loved the research but disliked going to work each day because of him. I remember my then boyfriend, now husband, kept his phone close when he knew I was working in case something happened. My husband is fairly laid back and not the paranoid type; I've never seen him as consistently concerned for my safety as when I was working for him.

I don't remember what the topic was for that week, but all of a sudden this instructor (also Chair) blurted out how ""he remembered when small p*nises used to be in"". At that point, any of the 15 students in the class could have reported him for sexual harassment. I gave him a weird look as I was confused where the comment came from and where he was going with this line of non-academic inquiry. In reaction to my puzzled look, he said out loud in front of all my peers, ""Well, I know YOU find that hard to believe."" I laughed off the moment as I realized that this tenured faculty member just called me a ""size queen"" in front of the whole class, which was a public slight on a sexuality level as a gay man and as biracial/black man."female,social&humanities,R2,"A professor had porn on when I walked into his office.

No colleague or student has ever openly tried to coerce me into sex. But, as we all know, microaggressions can cumulatively use up a lot of your energy. Here are just a couple of examples of the kinds of minor episodes I experienced on a near-daily basis in my pre-tenure years, and which still continue to a certain extent. (1) After my chair announced that I would be on parental leave the next semester because I was expecting my first child, my male colleague announced that he knew he'd noticed my ""muffin top"" during our last committee meeting. (2) Same colleague begins a conversation, ""I was walking behind a woman the other day, and at first I thought it was you, only I noticed she lacked a special something in her walk, a little wiggle, . . ."" (Well, you can imagine how it went from there.) (3) Same colleague asks me to help me pick out underwear from a catalog ""for his wife."" (4) Constant touching by particular senior male colleagues at conferences! The constant hugging, arm across the shoulder, arm linked through mine without permission. I love to give hugs, but I would never do it the way they do--unsolicited, a little too long, etc. Again, none of the above is severe in the sense that it's not open solicitation. It's not rape.

I had applied to a specific grad school and was awaiting response. Our department sponsored a conference and there were speakers from many places, including one luminary from York University whose work I followed and quoted. I was excited to talk to him. He asked me about my plans and when I told him I was waiting to hear from this particular school, he told me that he was in advanced discussion to take a job there as department head and that we should have a further discussion about this. I was over the moon of course because I thought I might get to study with him and maybe he could even help get my application noticed. I was confused and thought _岩uh-oh_ when he suggested we should meet in his room. But I agreed (feeling uneasy and later I blamed myself for this) because I was naive and he said he had his things there or made some potentially plausible excuse about why it made sense. Once we were there he started making not-so-subtle advances after 5 minutes and I pretended to not realize he was doing it. I kept trying to talk about the grad school. At that point I realized what I had gotten into and I was afraid both for my safety and also for spoiling any chance of getting into the one school I applied to! This mattered greatly because I had a Rotary scholarship to pay for the school but it was dependent upon me getting in. I didn_验t know what he would do if I rejected him or if he felt insulted. We basically pranced around the pretext for a while and he finally pressured me for a kiss. I apologized and told him I had to leave (which I did, unharmed). I worried for a couple months that he would get the job and that I would not be comfortable studying there, if I got in. I did get in and it wasn_验t until I arrived at the new school that I was certain he did not get that job. (This was pre-internet!) Then I was ashamed of myself for years. Every time I saw his book on my shelf, I felt disgusted, but it was an important book to the field so I had to keep it. Finally I threw it out and I no longer feel ashamed. He took advantage of a young lady and it could have affected my career because I would have dropped out of school rather than study with him and I would have lost my full scholarship for that.

The next semester, he gave a lecture where I was studying my M.A. and we once again went to a bar in a group after the event.

This was in 1990, so no email or cell phones--everything was done via landline and snail mail. I left town, got married and started a new job, and would periodically call and leave messages for the professor--or sometimes reach him, upon which he'd promise to get the notes to me (but then wouldn't). The university actually allowed me to ""walk"" at graduation but my degree wasn't officially awarded. This went on for about a year.Finally, during one phone call, my professor said that he'd be attending a conference in a city about an hour from where I lived, and that I should meet him there at the hotel, where he'd ""go over the notes with me."" From the tone of his voice, it was clear that he intended much more than a platonic discussion, and it was of course completely unnecessary for me to be in his presence to get his notes. Instead, I called my thesis chair and told him what the professor had suggested. I also pointed out how long I'd been waiting.

Turns out that the professor expected at least one of the women in field camp each year to sleep with him for the duration (6 weeks) of the course. It just didn't happen to be me, so i guess i warranted a bad final grade from him.

He would routinely proposition women students in his department and offer to get them internships, funding and jobs if they had sex with him. He was married with two kids. Apparently this activity was common knowledge to the entire institution for many, many years. Finally enough women came forward and complained. The school created a 'inquiry panel' and had all the women give their accounts of what happened (instead of outright firing this guy). I believe the true reason the institution finally gave in is because he was also embezzling and mis-appropriating funding, not for the harassment."male,natural,Other R1,A professor took a staff member out to dinner to proposition her in the guise of offering her a new job.

Following that, although I technically ""won"" against him, I was subjected to retribution in numerous forms for the remainder of my employment at the college. That went on for about 17 years. My daily life was filled with incidents. My students were also subjected to problems as a result of his constant harassment of me."male,social&humanities,Other R1,"I was a male grad student who witnessed this behavior by a male professor toward female undergrads. The students and professors in my program had a lot of informal social interaction, with clear lines and behavioral standards of course. One professor would attend parties with the undergrads and get inappropriately drunk and dance with or become handsy/close/etc with the students. To my knowledge he never assaulted anyone but I would watch him act extremely inappropriately, and the female undergrads could see exactly what was happening and were VERY weirded out by it. Several female students told me stories of being made to feel extremely uncomfortable/threatened personally by his behavior at past events as well, in this same manner. This happened about twice per semester, if not more. That this professor, then and now, taught a required course that all undergrads in the major have to take, and some of them have to be dragged kicking and screaming to take it seriously. (I on the other hand LOVE this material.) This guy's behavior and reputation definitely pushed many students away from taking this particular field of study seriously, which deeply upsets me. I will also add that several of the other grad students he worked with - before, during, and after my time - are distinctly similar in their approach to undergrads, and one of them started dating an undergrad while in his PhD program, which I felt weird about. I hate to think this professor is producing more people like him to sprinkle around the landscape in our field.

He offered to ""show me a good time"" if I went on vacation with him, and kept insisting once I turned him down. A colleague/friend who worked in the lab with me told me she'd made the mistake of giving him her cell phone number when she was hired, and she showed me messages sent late at night from him saying she was beautiful, asking her why she hadn't come by his office to say hi, and then angry and demanding ones calling her names for not answering him.

Present at this meeting was a senior male accounting professor and a female who worked in administration and was responsible for government grants. In that lunch I remember the male placing his hand on the thigh of the woman in charge of government grants. He had hoped to do it undetected by me but it was obvious in part, due to her expression. I had never witnessed anything like this and did not know what to do. I did nothing and pretended not to have noticed. She was visibly embarrassed and stiffly took his hand and moved it away from her thigh. I have often felt remorse at not having said anything and I have no idea whether the accounting professor had a relationship with this administrator or not. What I do remember is how awkward the situation was how embarrassed the administrator looked when it happened. She was much younger than him and unmarried. He was married. It was certainly inappropriate and my first real encounter with such a thing.

Also it was't normal flirtation as I've ever experienced it. For instance, I was taking art classes, including painting - he used to say he wanted to come watch me ""paint."" He asked if I did nudes - he made it clear that he meant that I would be naked. He tried to hug me, grab me, touch my thighs, body etc. I pulled away and tried to laugh it off until it was too much and I left. This happened many times, but I needed help - the exams were far more advanced than the lectures. Anyway, this continued with him trying to push it further and further. I finally told a fellow student study buddy, who was stunned... because the same guy had done the same thing to his girlfriend the previous year! The next year, I was at a restaurant downtown and I was obliquely talking to a friend about what had happened... the bartender was stunned and interrupted our conversation. A chemistry professor had come in one day and had told him all about how he seduced the students in his classes, and they were such easy pickings, and in fact he was there to meet one that night! The bartender saw him skeeving on the young woman who came in (they left together), and he was super disturbed by the guy, the whole conversation and the scene. He described the guy and also volunteered without prompting that the guy had a very prominent limp! Just like the guy who had been harassing me. So apparently I was one of many."male,applied&formal,Other R1,"I was leaving the school library around 1 a.m. and was followed by a male graduate student from my department into the parking garage. He had a weapon in his hand and the look on his face is something I'll never forget. He intended to hurt me and possibly kill me. You could see it in his face - the intent was clear. I ran as fast as I could and he chased me, though I was able to make it back to the library where I screamed for help. The on duty librarians called campus police. This happened because I had teased this graduate student in the research lab a week prior and the graduate student was angry at being publicly embarrassed by a female underclassmen. He had a history, not known to me then, of making inappropriate or very scary remarks to women in his cohort and his female committee chair. He had a history, not known to me then, of domestic and sexual violence against his ex-wife. He had been administratively released from military service against his ex-wife, not known to me then, but the military granted an administrative discharge because they categorized the violence as a result of PTSD from combat field violence. This administrative release allowed this graduate student to attend my institution on the GI bill which he wouldn't have received if he had been dishonorably discharged. This graduate student had followed me into the library that night and watched me for a total of 6 hours, lying in wait for me to leave. He had likely been stalking me for several days prior in know that I was in the library in the first place as neither of us lived on campus. I spent the rest of the semester terrified of him.

I had a brief romantic relationship with another grad student in my lab, but we did not publicize our relationship to our program nor to our mentor.

Several years later, my friend reported that her mentor (one of my committee members) asked about the nature of this relationship as he had witnessed ""evidence"" that we were romantically involved and wanted to know more details about the nature of our relationship as well as a prior relationship."non-binary,social&humanities,Small Liberal Arts College,"When I was a PhD candidate, a professor grabbed me around the waist and tickled me at a faculty reception, another professor tried to kiss me on several different occasions in the mail room, and yet another professor tried to kiss me while we were out walking and discussing math.

He would unload all kinds of personal problems onto me, expecting me to be his emotional support. Eventually the conversations turned sexual, and he asked me to send pictures, which I did. Dumbly, I thought maybe the relationship was ""real"" and went on to have sex with him and continued some semblance of a relationship post-graduation. I ended things eventually and moved out of the state. "male,social&humanities,Other R1,"I took a temporary research technician position in a cell biology lab in 2012, fresh out of college. Shortly after being hired, the PI began sexualizing me; looking down my shirt when talking to me, not taking me seriously as a scientist, very obviously 'checking me out.' The senior-most research assistant told me that the boss had deliberately scheduled my interview for a day when the research asst wasn't there, as research asst had been warning off people (especially young women) from taking this job. I was then informed that he had a history of harassing undergrads and similar aged employees and was regaled with stories of his highly inappropriate behavior, including why they no longer had evening lab outings due to his inappropriateness. The boss continued to act inappropriately towards me as well as being abusive towards myself and other lab members so I avoided him as much as possible. His approach to science and grant-based research was also suspect at best. During a lunch time holiday outing, he played with my hair and told me I looked like a Disney princess. I was extremely concerned with looking like a 'job hopper' but finally left after 9 months and on my last day, he was nowhere to be found. I left with the research asst and then boss called research asst and proceeded to rant about ""how much he had done for that bitch, how dare she just leave without saying goodbye, etc."" while I was in the car. I know there were at least 3-4 other undergrads/techs that he had been inappropriate with and most of the senior most members of the lab were aware of how he was, as well as whoever was on his tenure committee. It was an open secret to a large degree and there was a 'whisper network' for new graduate students to not join his lab, but this didn't help technicians like myself who were underpaid and generally couldn't just transfer labs. "male,social&humanities,Other R1,"I have heard so many stories, so will just report my own. I will only report three main ones. 1) In 2002 I was a brand new graduate student doing fieldwork in a remote location. I was warned in advance that the PI had a ""reputation"" so I was wary. After about a week we were all sitting around a campfire. I had avoided him, but he seemed to find me. He sat down and started talking. I admit to being abrupt with him, but didn't want to be rude so started talking more. He seemed just conversational but then asked about my body, which took me off guard. He laughed and said he just wanted to know what sports I had done in high school to shape my body for life. After telling him I had been a cheerleader he would frequently come up to me after and during work and say, ""You know, I had always wanted to date a cheerleader..."". It just just awkward, but these comments went on and on every day. No specific one seemed overtly disgusting, but I just wished it wasn't happening. There was a lot of drinking and smoking pot and playing games and as the fieldwork progressed it started to feel ""normal"" somehow. It seemed like he really liked me. I started to feel flattered. One night he kissed me. I broke it off, and he started to feel my chest. I told him no, and he persisted a bit but ultimately backed away...but he barely spoke to me for the rest of the fieldwork (many weeks). He found someone else who would sleep with him, which was a very clear message that had been his only plan the entire time. I felt dirty and used, like it was my fault, that I had instigated or encouraged it, and that there was no way I could ever tell anyone because I would be the fool who didn't see it coming. After all, hadn't I been adequately warned? A year or so later I saw him at a conference. I tried to sit away from him at dinner after the talks. He got drunker and drunker, and would not leave me alone. There was dancing. He would dance over to me and comment on how I moved, persistently, trying to touch me. I would just laugh and move away, trying to make light of it. I walked back to my hotel in a group, and said goodbye to them all in the lobby. The next thing I knew, he was calling my room at 3am asking if I could come see him. I had many roommates, one of whom answered the phone. I told him no way, but I'm sure it damaged my reputation. I just never had the guts to try to explain it to anyone. Fortunately, he was a PI at another institution and I never had to deal with him after that. He was married and had two kids the whole time. 2) In 2004 I was a mid-level graduate student and I was doing fieldwork in a different place. There was a senior graduate student who was in a supervisory position (married, with two kids). Several of us took a night off on a weekend to go into a town, and stayed in a hostel. There was drinking. This man got very drunk and was all over me, whispering in my ear ""I'm going to make you come over and over"" and groping me. I told him no, no, no, so many times. I tried to squirm away. I didn't want to make a fuss about it because I had to work with him, and everyone knew him as the ""dirty old man"" anyway so I figured they would just see it as me making a big deal out of nothing. I could not seem to get away from him without raising a fuss. We were in a shared room with several other people and I took the top bunk. He got up there with me, trying to touch me, and I just kept shoving him away with my feet. I really didn't want to make the situation awkward for other people, or for myself when everyone woke up the next morning and had to go back to work together. I must have stayed like that for an hour or more, just shoving his hands back with my feet through my sleeping bag until eventually I guess he just passed out. The next morning he pretended like nothing had happened, and every once in a while I see him and he hugs too long, squeezes too tight...but he does that to all the women, so I feel like if I brought it up I would look conceited. There were rumors that all the men (PIs and male graduate students) would get together and rate the female graduate students and undergraduates on the fieldwork. I can't know if any of that was actually true, but I would not be surprised. 3) In 2016 I was a TT Asst. Prof. I thought all of this was behind me. I am married with two children. I did not think I would be a target any longer, because I was now ""old"" and cynical. I was invited to attend a workshop. Afterwards, several of us colleagues went out...and out...and out. We just kept going from place to place, chatting, having a great time, generating ideas. We were in a group. It felt like my grad school years, but the good parts of them. I chatted for a while with someone who was probably about my age. We knew a lot of the same people, but had never met in person. I showed abundant pictures of my husband and family. He seemed to like seeing them. At the last place, the music was loud. I went to the bathroom and when I came back everyone was gone except for this guy. I asked where they went and he said they had all left. I thought that was weird, and since I had been following the group I didn't really know where I was. I started trying to figure out how to get back to my lodging. A rad song from the 80s started playing and I said I liked it. This guy said I should dance to it then. So we danced, not touching, in a crowd. It was fun - I hadn't done something like that in maybe 10 years. We kept dancing, and he kept getting closer. I kept trying to keep it light, keep my distance, but he kept getting closer and I could not find a way to move away without making it awkward, feeling like he was trying something that I was telling myself he couldn't possibly be trying. After all, he'd seen my family photos and I was no longer a young, naive graduate student right? It just kept happening and I couldn't find a way to stop the situation without bringing attention to it. I felt like that would be awkward, sort of like accusing him of something, which to me felt both conceited and like it could become an issue if we ever worked together in the future. Eventually he pulled me in all of a sudden and planted a huge kiss on my mouth. That was a pretty clear signal that it wasn't all in my head, so I pushed him away and scolded him and reminded him I was happily married. He just smiled and acted like nothing had happened and tried again...and again...after a couple of minutes of trying to ""be normal"" I just gave up and said I needed to go. He walked with me, pretending like nothing had happened. I felt a terrible, awful guilt - just like back in grad school, like I must have been responsible for it simply because I hadn't made a big protest about it at the start. He kept trying to take me on all these detours back to my lodging to ""show me things around the city"". I eventually just got out my phone and found it myself, feeling stupid that I had let that happen on top of everything else. I still feel terrible, like I've done something wrong. I saw him later at a conference and pretended he didn't exist; he did the same. It all felt so childish, stupid, and like being back in high school, which was very distracting when I was supposed to be at a professional conference. Those are just three incidents. They do not include all the many times I have to greet senior men and they hug too long, kiss on the cheek too long, and make comments about my appearance. One committee member told me at my dissertation defense (in front of the crowd) that I sure didn't look like I'd just had a baby (my son was about a month old at the time). It's just tiring. I was glad to get old enough and secure enough to be what I thought was beyond all of that..."male,social&humanities,Other R1,"- the most serious incident involved a fellow PhD student in my department, Political Science, at York University in Toronto. We had been friends, strictly platonic, not even flirting, since I started the program (three years by then). One night we ran into each other at a free outdoor concert. I had drank one large beer prior. We went back to his apartment with some friends of mine and his brother and his brother's friends. At his apartment he made me a drink. I don't remember anything after that. I woke up the next day, terrified and unable to even move my body. I felt extremely ill. I didn't know own where I was. I was in a strange bedroom. There was no one else there. I was also naked and covered with scrapes and bruises. It took hours of laying there terrified before I felt well enough to try and get up and find my clothes. Eventually he came into the bedroom and my heart sank as I realized where I was. I was shocked. I would have never ever consented to sex with him. I identified as a lesbian at the time. Openly. He knew I was a lesbian. We had never flirted. He had a girlfriend who was a friend of mine. I asked him what happened. He said that I came on to him. I told him I was ""in love"" with him. Then he said that he had sex with me. He said the scrapes were from me falling down because I couldn't walk straight and then a few minutes later said, ""but I didn't think you were that drunk""... He also said that I tried to run out of the apartment naked and he chased me. He laughed as if it was a funny thing for me to do. He said I told him that ""men always tell women what to do!"" I have absolutely no memory of it myself. I have to trust him version. But I don't. An expert told me that it sounded like I had been drugged. Even if I wasn't, if I was so drunk that I was falling down and badly scraping my body (if that is where the scrapes came from) how could he not realize that I was too drunk to consent. If I passed out, which I must have, why did he just leave me alone in his room all morning and not check on me or call an ambulance? I was so humiliated and scared that I wasn't thinking right. I made him promise not to tell anyone. I went home as fast as I could. I told myself never to think of it ever again. I tried to burry it. But I couldn't. I started to hate academia. He became more and more successful and I became depressed and withdrawn. I have seen other male PhD students in my department go after young undergrad women, often when they are drunk at campus bars, in predatory ways. I've heard rumours of tenured professors doing the same thing to female grad students. Every grad student party I went to I felt uncomfortable at. Men would touch your arm or lower back without asking, they barely knew me. They would flirt. I can't count how many times that happened but I can count (5 in total) how many of my male colleagues ever asked me about my research in the total 7 years I was there.

He made sexual gestures once standing in the back of the room while I was presenting a paper in a class.Example 2: I was in my second year in the same program. A student contacted me after we exchanged numbers while working on a class project. He wanted to get a workout buddy. I was game at first but wanted to make sure he was aware I had a boyfriend and would not date other people in the program under any circumstances. He assured me he was gay and we were just friends. We hung out a couple of times and then he turned really touchy-feely. I made it known I did not like that. He apologized but then called me again and again begging me to hang out. I did not want to so I texted him back and said I was not interested because I found him too involved in my personal life and needed to just keep things professional. He responded by threatening to kill himself if I would not see him and pleaded with me to leave my boyfriend. After I blocked his number and reported it, he insisted on sitting next to me in class, trying to have sidebar conversations with me, and stole my notes while I was writing.

He admitted to having been sympathetic to red pill attitudes, having abused his girlfriend, and having wanted to physically attack a previous female roommate after a fight over laundry. I lived with him and one other roommate. Two nights after my third roommate moved out, we went to a dinner at some friends. When we returned he expressed interest in me. I turned him down but he proceeded to argue with me for two hours about my reasons for turning him down. I did think it was strange that the time he'd choose to make his interest known was when there was no one else in the department and I was drunk, but I chalked it up to bad decision-making. Two weeks later we were at a bar and he kept buying my shots because I was celebrating an academic success with our colleagues. When we got home he again propositioned me again and argued with me for more than an hour instead of accepting my answer. He also physically blocked me from leaving my seat during this until I begged to go to the bathroom. Once I got away I barricaded myself in my room, since my door didn't have a lock. Several nights later I awoke to seeing him standing outside of my door looking in at me. I confessed what happened to a female colleague and she told me he had hit on her when she first got to campus. I heard a similar story from a third female colleague. I felt these incidents were likely to continue and escalate and sought recourse from the faculty to prevent that from happening. I also thought I had an obligation as an employee of the institution to report sexual harassment, but apparently there is a loophole where you can decline to report sexual harassment directed towards yourself. I was unaware of this. A female colleague was supposed to replace me in the house and she was good friends with him, so I didn't think she would listen if I tried to warn her. I thought the best way to protect her, other female colleagues, and the undergraduates that he supervised as a teaching assistant was to report the situation to the Dean of my department.

At the time, I was very close to this man and believed him to be my mentor. At dinner, I ordered a martini. He heavily encouraged me to have more than one--at one point even ordering one for me. After dinner, he drove to a park, where he held me and tried to kiss me. I told him I wanted to go home. Instead of taking me to my apartment, he drove straight to his house. He wanted to slow dance and grope me and smoke weed. When I said I wanted to leave, he said he couldn't drive and then told me I could lie down. I went into the bedroom without him and shut the door to try to think of how to get out of this house. He entered and grabbed me, saying ""I love you like a daughter, like a lover...I don't know what."" I reiterated I wanted to leave. I felt extreme pressure, since at the time my thesis grade was still out and this man was solely responsible for that grade. Finally, he took me home--after I said I was leaving.

She let go and then I just stared at her trying to understand why all this was happening, trying to read her, if she was drunk or drugged or just self-absorbed. She pulled me in again and hugged me for a long time again. It was more confusing so I pulled away and tried to joke about it all and ran off. I wondered where the hell her husband was and why he never came back from his room! Was this a planned situation? I can't help but think the way things unfolded that it's not unusual and she said it later that she did this with others. I called a friend that night on my way home and told her. She was blown away but I just joked and tried to play if off. The next day I was really triggered and couldn't stop talking about my childhood trauma and also how bad I felt for feeling aroused by my chair's behavior with me. I was still very confused. I told another friend and she was very angry. I attempted to process it with my chair but she instead threatened that I shouldn't tell anyone especially not my campus therapist or she would get in big trouble. I still didn't understand the magnitude of this and I couldn't process it all. We finally met after several weeks of back and forth and she blamed me for everything. She said it was my fault that I came over and that she knew I had feelings for her and so I should've told her at the start and that would've never happened. She said I should've had better boundaries and that I couldn't blame her for my past issues. I didn't know what to say. I just kept saying that what I felt about her wasn't what she was claiming. We went round and round then she said I hoped I felt better now that we cleared it up and we should only meet to work on my dissertation and she scheduled a date. I was numb. I felt a pit in my stomach like something was very wrong and it was only going to get worse. She asked me what I was feeling now that we had talked things out and I told her I felt anxiety. We walked to the parking lot to her car and she asked me if she could have a hug. I just started to cry. She gave me a hug and I walked off knowing I had to do something else to never have to see her again. The problem is we share a ton of circles in and outside of the university. I left feeling afraid and more confused and not sure who to confide in. I ended up telling my therapist and he urged me to report it to the university. I also changed chairs but not without some trouble with the department. I didn't say why which was part of the trouble but I was finally able to do it. By then I was feeling angry instead of afraid and confused and I wrote her a long email explaining how she made me feel and how upset I was with her. She responded with how it wasn't her intent and that I had mis-characterized her. It was still about her and not what she did to me. I blocked her and asked her to delete any shared online spaces with me which she has. In that email I also told her I wasn't going to lie to people if we showed up to shared spaces and they asked why we weren't speaking. Since then, she hasn't shown up to 3 shared events which makes me feel like maybe she does finally realize she was wrong with what she did to me. Still I am angry that I constantly have flashbacks and find myself thinking about what happened and still trying to make peace with it. She gets to continue her privileged life while I continue struggling with the emotional distress of either keeping this to myself or speaking out- either way it's still an undue burden for me to carry with no real resolution in sight. I hate her for that but I can't reconcile how I felt about her prior to that evening. I hate her for that too! I have since shared what happened with my family and at least half of my cohort who have been very supportive and also encouraging me to report to the university."male,NotAvailable,Other R1,"I was on a graduate school interview and went to a social event with current graduate students in the program. We went out to dinner and then to a bar where one of the more senior graduate students told another female applicant and me that his evaluations of us, which he implied would be shared with the selection committee, would be higher if we kissed each other. I laughed it off uncomfortably, but he was not joking. This person was a clinical psychology graduate student. Blatant coercion and sexual harassment are completely antithetical to the code of ethics for clinical psychologists."male,social&humanities,Other R1,"I worked with this professor and also took his graduate-level class. There were always rumors that he had been/was dating undergraduate students. For the grad class, he required one-on-one meetings to discuss our papers, and would often shut the door during the meetings. He asked nearly every woman-identified student to meet with him at a bar to ""discuss the paper"" and suggest he was asking ONLY that person because they were ""special."" For the students that met with him, he didn't discuss the course or paper at all, and would ask really personal questions, including about their ""love life."" He rarely returned graded papers and graded based on how he felt about a student. In one instance he lowered a student's grade after she confronted him.When I worked for him I could tell he was trying to groom me. He would rarely discuss work and try to tell me how ""special"" I was. He frequently made sexist comments about students and faculty, including saying that women were too ""maternal"" to be good professors, ""especially in our department."" He insisted on hugging me twice, and both times were awkward and too long. "male,social&humanities,Small Liberal Arts College,"A professor continually praised my work in class, occasionally stopping the lecture to go into deviations that allowed me to speak more. I was quite encouraged by this and believed my work was genuinely good. This also included deviations into personal interests during class - pop culture and things, so off-topic but nothing that seemed too inappropriate. The professor started to suggest that one of my paper ideas could be a major article and started to invite me to his office occasionally. He also started to talk about me maybe working for his research center and that I should think about continuing past the master's. I ignored what now seem like deliberate attempts for him to get closer to me personally because I knew he had a girlfriend, who was a former student he mentored who still worked for the department. His relationship, and that he started this just a day or two after his class with her ended (and that he had also singled her out in class, like me), was public knowledge for other professors and some students. However, after he broke up with her he began to find awkward ways to point out that he was now single, and he became more aggressive in trying to find out about and discuss my non-academic interests. Discussions about me writing an article with his help, working for him, and and maybe even pursuing the PhD became more serious.I eventually spoke to the professor in the most non-confrontational manner I could. I told him that I was excited about working on projects with him, but made it clear that I try to draw lines between work / school and my personal life. His reaction was very calm, including a few lines about just trying to be friendly. However, in the coming days he gave tepid responses to e-mails about my research or possibly working for his research center, citing his schedule and other issues. He also lacked his previous excitement when he saw me and would try to leave the area quickly.

I'm torn between the public time he told me that I should have kids when I was raising an issue around placement testing & curriculum OR the time he told me privately, after evaluating my teaching, that he thought I should be working in an s & m club.

The majority of Senior lab members were male (i.e post docs and PI) and while my PI did not participate directly, he did not curtail the stream of offensive and explicit commentry spewed forth by a couple of the younger male post docs. Those guys would casually rate female scientists on their appearence and discuss their ""fuckability at lunch."" I was often bullied or excluded from lab events,for telling these guys that I wasn't comfortable with their discussions - the only TWO female post docs would laugh along with the guys, the rest of the women were older technicians who stuck to themselves.

He put me down, I started to back up, and he picked me up again and continued, saying he ""just had to"" do it again. I can't remember a lot more details after that because I was trying to figure out how to get away--I was literally in a room designed so that no one would know what was happening inside of it.

I was too intimidated and confused to report him as nothing was overtly ""wrong"" although I knew he wouldn't do the same things to male students.

Another time, I ran into him at the train station, where he complimented me on my physical appearance (I was dressed up) and proceeded to sit down next to me on the bench and get as close as he possibly could, while talking as in my face as possibleWhen he emailed me about the project we were working on, he detailed his physical exercise routine and that he had been swimming daily over the summer, as if I was interested? And whether I had had an exciting summer?' . I lessened my involvement in the project so I would avoid being around him - even on campus, he would make a beeline for me, often ignoring my female friend who also worked on the project, so it made it even more obvious he had a thing for me.

After my second child, I realized I had stepped into the _岩mothers_ network (female, less power) and been pushed out of the male power group. There were many subtle changes, but one particular incident when in a meeting filled with high ups, the president of the college said to me, _岩I get it. You_验re a mother now. You live in the suburbs. You have lost your edge._ The public harassment continued when there would be hours of meetings when I was yelled at and maligned by the highest men in the college. And was the only woman in the room. And honestly, for no performance-based reason. I realized I was being pushed out, so I left. And I signed a nondisclosure agreement in exchange for 4 months salary. And I left behind a career and 15 years of unquestioneable success under the same president. I was essentially replaced with a younger, childless version of myself.

I was left out of authorship of publications in which I had a considerable amount of contribution on in direct response to my rejection to this graduate student. I cannot say what has happened to this other female as I decided to leave the lab due to this male graduate student threatening me and not allowing me the same recognition and opportunities as my male peers and the lack of response from our male professor. "male,NotAvailable,Other R1,"In 2004 at the AAG (large disciplinary conference) a professor (not sure of rank, but more than twice my age) cornered me at my poster to tell me his sexual fetishes.

My male colleague, who has less time at the institution, has made statements such as ""strange vibe"". He would say that he wished we would communicate more. I felt completely uncomfortable around this colleague who would seek me out at conferences, interupt meetings to run after me and other awkward experiences. I reported to the administration and they did nothing. I told my colleagues and they just would say don't pay it any mind or that he was a jerk.This was not enough. More should have been done.

Some women students, ranging from indicating a willingness to strongly suggesting to outwardly offering to, engage in sex as a means to a good grade or passing a course. I, and other men, felt extremely uncomfortable with the fear of false charges and awkwardness in dealing wit such students, especially in private."male,social&humanities,Regional Teaching College,Supervisor asked if he could take nude photographs of me.male,natural,Other Type of School,"I was ABD doing research at a small archive which had given me a fellowship. Part of the fellowship included free residence on site adjacent to the archive. The archive and residence were in rural Pennsylvania, and at the time I was in residence only I and the live-in academic director of the archive, a more senior male ABD from another institution, were living on site. One other full time staff person was on site during the day but I was told not to bother her. The male director started off nice enough, but over the course of my month long fellowship, started to make comments about my weight, my appearance, and the appearance of the female high school student who worked a few days a week. Comments escalated to things about how lucky or whipped my male partner must be to put up with me, and when another male fellow arrived who was polite and friendly, comments about how we must be having an affair. The man making the comments was the person administering my fellowship, and the residence was isolated in a rural area without doors that locked, so I decided to leave early. I explained the situation to my dissertation director, who was supportive once he found out the details, but advised against reporting to the archive's board of trustees because it would either do nothing or prevent me from getting future funding. While the man who harassed me was still at the archive, I told all the women intending to work there about what happened to me, and most experienced similar. He has since left the position."male,social&humanities,Other R1,"I was a graduate student and in an elevator with a male tenured professor in my department, who advised one of my comprehensive exams. When the elevator doors closed, the male professor slowly looked my body up and down. Then he did it a second time. He wasn't even trying to hide what he was doing. He told me I looked nice and asked me why I was so dressed up today. I managed to squeak out an answer (something about how I was teaching that day), and then fled the elevator as soon as the doors opened. This faculty member very publicly leers at other women graduate students in my program (even when he's teaching us in the classroom), and he has a history of other inappropriate behaviors toward women students."male,social&humanities,Other R1,"The gist: a senior ""rockstar"" colleague in my field (married, with children) invited me to join a conference panel with him and some other senior colleagues. This ended up being a pretense for trying to have sex with me, though, and after I rejected him, this colleague later went on to spread vicious rumors about me and attempted to thwart and ruin my career. The details: this senior ""rockstar"" contacted me about serving on a panel with him at an upcoming national conference, then proceeded to send me lewd text messages (including photos of his genitalia) in the months leading up to the conference. I explained several times that I was married, that I wasn't interested, but I was relying on this conference panel to boost my sphere of contacts and so tried to take a lighthearted and laughing approach to his advances. This involved continuously steering the text message and email conversations back towards more professional topics. He told me to arrive a day early to the conference because a big dinner was planned and he would be able to introduce me to some influential people. I did as he instructed, but there was no big dinner: it was reservation for two, and included only me and him. During the dinner, he told me that he had an erection and he pressed himself against me under the table. He was convinced that we would wind up having sex with each other, which he told me point blank. I made excuses, laughed it off, and exited the dinner as quickly as possible, trying to save face. Once I got back to my hotel room, though, he started texting me: the messages started out as imploring (""I'm just so attracted to you, I couldn't control myself"") and then, when I didn't respond, they turned threatening (""I can put you in touch with the right people at this conference. I can also make sure that you never get to spend time in the same room as them."") The next day at the conference, I experienced multiple rounds of cold-shouldering from him and his cohort: I would enter a room and a group of men (usually including him) would laugh and get up and leave. I later learned from a close friend / colleague (one of this man's former graduate advisees) that he had told everyone that we had had sex the night before, but that afterwords I had gotten ""crazy"" and ""weird,"" which was why he felt the need to avoid me. His group of male associates still avoids me at conferences to this day. And I still see this man -- everywhere, at multiple events throughout the year -- to this day. "male,NotDetected,Other R1,1992 at the University of Houston business schoolmale,social&humanities,Other R1,"I had just finished my undergraduate thesis and was still at the College, preparing to apply to graduate school. My male adviser wanted to have an affair with me. I did not want to have an affair with him, but felt pressure to do so. I then tried to break it off, very clumsily I am sure since I was about 21 and felt that the whole situation was unbearably awkward. He was close friends with my other adviser, a feminist professor whom I had been working under for a long time and looked up to. He must have complained to her. When I asked her to write letters of recommendation for me for graduate school, she refused. She told me that she did not like how I had treated her friend, and therefore could not recommend me as a colleague. It was a consensual affair, so I do not blame him overly much, though clearly I was too young to be involved with him and there was a power imbalance in the relationship because of his role as my mentor. I blame more my feminist adviser for her vindictiveness, which I feel breached an acceptable standard of professional ethics. "male,social&humanities,R2,1992 at the University of Houston business school female,social&humanities,R2,"Between 2009 and 2012, as an assistant professor, I was repeatedly told by tenured male colleagues in my department that the only way I could receive tenure was to demonstrate my ""loyalty"" to the department by getting married and purchasing property. I was the only unmarried person in the department - there was only one other female faculty member in the department. At one point (2011), a male colleague (tenured) made comments during a faculty meeting about the fact that I was unmarried and wondered aloud about my sexual partners. No one said anything."female,social&humanities,R2,"I was a visiting assistant professor and the department chair had a party at her house at the beginning of the semester. It was strange as there was a lot of drinking and she even invited undergraduate students. Throughout the party she kept implying that I was single in front of a t-t Assistant professor, we both felt awkward about it and it was fine. Any ways I met several people and one was the partner (they had a child together) of another instructor in our department. We chatted and it was fine. He also worked as an instructor on campus in another department. Later he would come by her office routinely when she was not there and talk to me, and complain about her. I tried to be polite but eventually he called me in the middle of the night, asking me where I lived, and could he come over. I felt very strange as he was a colleague's partner (besides I was not interested). The next year I became friends with his partner and I did not tell her what happened, one night she showed up at my apartment with her daughter, he had taken her phone, computer, and assaulted her, she stayed at my place and would not call the police. I later texted him that if it happened again I would call the police, and he threatened to go to Human Resources and to report me for harassing him, and to stay away from his partner. I told him to go ahead. Nothing happened. "male,social&humanities,Other R1,"I was an undergraduate at a NYC campus of a Bronx private university. It was the end of the period of registration for classes. I sat in on a class that seemed perfect for me. I approached the teacher after class to sign my ""add class"" card. He offered to sign it for me in his office. As soon as we entered the elevator and the door closed, he pounced on me and in a few seconds had me on the floor. I was taken aback but quickly concluded that his intentions were based on love (this was the mid 60s and he was affiliated with the Church). He repeated his actions in his office and then pursued a sexual relationship with me which ended several months later because he said he was conflicted about his religious commitment. I was devastated. Many years later, after he left the Church and married he discovered where I was working and began visiting me there on occasions. Each time, he would embrace me with an inappropriate French kiss which I did not welcome. Finally I told him that I did not forget what had happened to me when I was an impressionable student, that it was not proper, was an abuse of his authority as a teacher and his religious affiliation. He responded that he also remembered the incident with regret, that he suffered about it, and wanted to apologize. I did not accept the offer and never heard from him again. I graduated some years later after the incident but never expected to have the chance to denounce it in some way and now believe if it happened to me, it's likely to have happened to others and may still be happening as he now holds a position with greater authority (not in academia). Therefore I am adding this incident to your document."male,applied&formal,R2,"A professor responsible for a group of us on a study abroad in the Czech Republic engaged in an ""open secret"" affair with a undergrad. There was a pretty out of control incident in a hotel room where nude photos were taken involving female students and the professor. There was a lot of heavy drinking involved in the situation. Some students were severely uncomfortable with what happened, and it was public knowledge about the nudity, the photos, the sex. The people upset/uncomfortable were considered party poopers spoiling the fun. There was pressure to just go along with things. It was well known the professor was doing something very inappropriate, and met with eyerolls from other professors."male,applied&formal,Other R1,"A professor and I were alone in the office.

Was pledging a fraternity as a freshman (undergrad). Pledgemates (NOT actual fraternity brothers) called in the wee hours of the night to inform me of a false ""emergency meeting"" supposedly called by the fraternity. Turned out to be a drinking session in my pledgemates' dorm, followed by a prank of building a giant ""snow penis"" on the quad, for some stupid reason all done with our pants removed in the cold weather and extremely drunk. After building the snow penis, the largest member of the group threw me to the ground and removed my boxers, leaving my bare genitals and buttocks exposed to snow, and me covering my freezing genitals to prevent frostbite."male,social&humanities,Elite Institution/Ivy League,"I was an undergraduate and was in charge of showing some important visitors around the campus before an event. I asked my male advisor (full professor) what type of dress would be most appropriate. He responded: ""If I had it my way, you'd wear nothing at all."" I was 19, and hoped to continue on in the field and pursue a PhD (which I did, I am now a tenured professor in the field). I feared the repercussions of reporting him. Who would write me a letter of recommendation for graduate school? Would I be destroying any prospects I had in this field? He was well-connected and the field (even internationally) is small. This was also 2002, in a private institution in the Midwest, and there was not widespread support for victims of sexual harassment. "male,social&humanities,Other Type of School,"My department head left for another job and Professor X. took his place. Prof. X. had been hired a few years before; his letters and CV were impressive, and he had decades of prior experience. The school was constantly pushing diversity rhetoric and was thrilled to have a faculty member who was from a diverse ethnic background. He was asked to serve on or chair many committees. Students loved him. He was personable and warm and became popular at this small liberal arts college. A married female professor from another department began to sneak into his office in the late afternoons and spent considerable time there with the door closed. We were told they were having ""Bible study."" Later, other mature women whom I did not recognize began to appear for late afternoon closed door visits. Prof. X also showed an inappropriate level of interest in a student intern in the office. She said nothing untoward was happening but after a few months she became obviously burdened and unhappy and eventually dropped out of school. Our married department secretary was also blatantly wooed by him but she shut him down after a few weeks. (Prof. X was also married, but his wife lived in another city.) The first Bible study woman became Provost. It was time for my tenure review. I had passed a fourth-year review under the previous department head with no indication of problems, but Prof. X. became very hostile towards me as soon as he was made department head. He sabotaged me in various ways and gave me lukewarm performance reviews. It was so bad that I asked the Provost if I could leave the tenure track and go on contract instead. She said no. While the tenure process was initially going well, one day he invited my committee to a meeting. A big supporter who was on my committee said she left that meeting feeling somehow convinced that I was undeserving. Although she shook that off and continued to be of great support, I suspect that I lost the support of the others; eventually I was denied tenure. There were other factors and I don't claim to be perfect, but I believe that under the previous department head I would have been tenured.This was in December. As the academic year progressed Prof. X's behavior became more and more bizarre. He began to miss classes and disappear for days at a time. The following summer I was told confidentially (there was of course a non-disclosure agreement) that he had been forced to resign. It turned out that he had been defrocked by his church for inappropriate ""counseling"" sessions and the administration became aware that the same sort of behavior had occurred on campus. It was later discovered that he had left his previous job, along with his leadership position in a different religious denomination, under similar circumstances."male,applied&formal,Elite Institution/Ivy League,"A c-level officer of the college would regularly follow me into the restroom and berate me while I was at the urinal with my back to him. He stated that he could say whatever he wanted and that anything he said was true because he was the boss. He stated that my job was to be loyal to him and not to creating honest reports. I started only going to the bathroom when he was not around and going to different floors to avoid him. This same individual regularly made demeaning comments about his female superiors and board members, stating that no woman could tell him what to do. This same individual made inappropriate comments about an investigation into the alleged rape of a student by a public safety officer of the college. When I reported my bathroom experiences through the school grievance process to HR and to the offender's boss, I was charged with insubordination. The school claimed that because I only verbally told them the information, I was not protected by the grievance policy. I asked the school President for help in a confidential email and he had his secretary reply to me (breach of confidence) that he was not in the proper channel and would not see me. Subsequently, my employment was terminated by the school using circuitous means, and the offending individual called others in the industry to dissuade them from hiring me. The school attempted to have me sign a NDA giving up my right to sue the school or the individual. In exchange, they offered one quarter of my salary."male,applied&formal,Elite Institution/Ivy League,I was asked out on a date by a student. male,social&humanities,Other R1,"At the International Conference on Thinking, Brown University, Providence Rhode Island 4-6 August 2016, I invited two male Academics to post-conference dinner drinks 5th August 2016. They were peers of my supervisor who had discussed my poster presentation with me, so I felt inclined to host them for the night. We all had a great time talking, laughing and even discussing our partners and wedding rings. I got up at one stage and started dancing to a song. One of them got up and started dancing too. He said, ""in Brazil we like to dance close""... I did not want to dance 'closely' with him, but I didn't want to sour the mood, be seen as up tight, or threaten potential future research opportunities, so I agreed under duress. The moment he got close to me, he started aggressively groping my whole body with both hands and his own body, holding me in a vice-like grip. Meanwhile, his co-researcher leapt up from behind and said, 'hey, where's mine?' and stuck his tongue into my ear and licked vigorously down my neck. Trapped between the two men I was terrified and backed away, back to the table we had been sitting at (a booth). Everyone sat back down at the table. I was at a loss at what to do next. The way the men were looking at me, as the leader of the social event; waiting for me... I felt that they were hoping I'd say something like ""hey guys, what a great start, why don't we all go back to my dorm room and really get going""... While trying to find some words, I felt the hand of the first Academic sliding over my thighs, towards my vulva. Meanwhile I felt the foot of the second Academic sliding up my own foot and calf towards my vulva. I felt attacked by two snakes. I leapt up, said that I was leaving and rushed out the door. I had no phone as I was in a foreign country. The senior Academic followed me down the street and tried to dismiss the situation as 'miscommunication'. I can assure you that I had not invited this attention and have never experienced anything like it either professionally or as a single woman socially. As a final insult the Academic wanted to 'hug it out', which I did, because I was scared of angering him, alone at midnight on a dark college street. Finally I got to my dorm room. I couldn't face the conference the next day. I didn't want to talk about what had happened to the conference organiser or to risk seeing either of these men again. As a direct consequence of this event I became fearful of men generally and revulsed by Academia more generally. I managed to attend some of my next conference in Cognitive Science in Philadelphia, but found myself anxious, stressed and depressed. The incident has had impacts on my mental and physical health, my intimate relationship with my partner and my career pathway--I changed my Academic research priority away from the subject area these men worked in, as I never wanted to see them again."male,natural,Other R1,"Some examples: 1. A lecturer who I had never spoken to drunkenly groped me at a department happy hour. It was well known that he sexually harassed students in the masters program he coordinated. After a number of years his contract was not renewed. It turned out he was also harassing faculty members in the department. 2. My advisor talked negatively about a female postdoc in my department and how she dressed too fashionably. It made me always second guess what I wore and if I would be taken seriously. 3. A male collaborator at a national lab made it a point to mentor my male colleagues and talk science with them, whereas with me he never discussed anything scientific and would strike up awkward conversations about things like what to do if a woman starts crying in your office, or wondering if women wore socks or not. 4. At a conference dinner, a respected senior professor told sexist jokes to myself and female grad students. 5. A member of my research group who was more senior to me said that if we ever made a research group nude calendar, I_验d need extra big items to cover up my boobs. He framed it in the context of _焉I know you_验re cool so I can say this to you_验 but in reality it made me feel really uncomfortable. 6. Being ignored in group meetings- I would say something and no one would acknowledge it, then a man would say it and they would. I have lots of friends with far worse stories than this- for me it was lots of small things that made me feel like I wasn_验t respected or didn_验t belong. "male,social&humanities,Other Type of School,"On multiple occasions when meeting with one of my supervisors he would at some stage be staring at my chest for an extended period. I thought maybe I was imagining it or over-interpreting it, until another female student said he regularly did the same to her. She called him out on it at least once."male,social&humanities,Elite Institution/Ivy League,"My advisor admitted, drunkenly, that I reminded him of his ex-wife in ""multiple ways."" This meant he would often be harder on me than any of his other students, and took his anger out on me in ways that were in no way appropriate. I eventually left the field because of his systematic harassment and discrimination. "male,natural,Elite Institution/Ivy League,"Pervasive, long-term predatory behavior, assault, harassment, and retaliation amongst a number of the senior male faculty in a department named multiple times on this spreadsheet. Male faculty assaulting, intoxicating, and impregnating (I am not exaggerating, this has happened twice in five years) female graduate students, and, sadly, undergraduates. Ending contracts of female contingent faculty (who are too senior to be contingent in the first place) for refusing the advances of senior leadership. Multiple faculty targeting vulnerable women. As far as I know, not a single woman graduate student has made it through her first two years in the program without being victimized. Because so many department leaders, including the chair, have been serially harassing so many female graduate students, contingent faculty, and junior faculty for so long, to expose them would be to expose the university at large. As such, university leadership is colluding with a weak Title IX office and complicit HR officials to retaliate against anyone who speaks up, and to allow punished faculty back on the job after ""rehabilitation"" when they are a clear threat. Senior faculty members who are in a position to do something about the problem fear this retaliation and are rewarded with inflated salaries and random small grants and sweetened work assignments for minimizing the problem by not reporting or discouraging victims from reporting. Some are in denial; others cynically play along. At least two male graduate students sleeping with their undergraduate students on the day they turn grades in: because senior faculty has told them in no uncertain terms (and these male grad students have seen faculty do this with their own students): ""You can sleep with them as soon as grades are turned in."" I was a partner hire who was essentially fired for breaking up with my partner, who was abusing his departmental power over me to control the relationship (which was unacceptable), and I did due ethical diligence for a graduate student who told me she had been raped by my colleague with devastating results. I was told by the chair that my job was being terminated because I was only at the university to retain my former partner, and was otherwise useless. My academic career--a book and a near-forthcoming contract for a second, a dozen peer-reviewed articles, a series of major funding awards, major teaching awards, keynotes, and advocacy for minoritized students--is over. Hearing this word around town (he was friends with one of the faculty harassers), one of the harassing male graduate students grabbed me by my waist in a public place at night, pulled me to his body and put his mouth to my ear. It turns out he had physically assaulted nearly all of the women in his cohort but was allowed to remain in graduate School there. I ran screaming from academia and have been diagnosed with PTSD. I am fighting form the outside. But of course this was only one setting for the harassment I've experienced: suggestive touches, grooming, even propositions. That being said, I never dreamed it could be as bad as this department was. "male,social&humanities,Other R1,"My major professor made a ""pass"" by asking to kiss me within a couple of weeks of arriving at the program. I was told by other grad students that sexual predation was very common by the male faculty and that often students were willing. I was not willing, and the professor did not push the matter, nor punish me for refusing his advance. However, he made the same advance on his next grad student and they entered a relationship that led to inequitable treatment of his other advisees (who were obliviousness as to the relationship). He then proceeded to sleep with a series of subsequent students. This experience and the overall hostility toward women that I experienced at this university in the early 1990s were not unique. One female faculty member told me that the chemistry department had barred one of their pregnant colleagues from faculty meetings when her pregnancy began to show. There were other stories that circulated about how female faculty members were treated inequitably in the promotion and tenure process, particularly if their research addressed gender. I don't know the truth of these narratives, but they contributed to a culture of gender marginalization.The universities I've been at since have frowned on faculty sleeping with students - which is a significant improvement. At my current university, faculty have been fired for inappropriate sexual conduct. However, I've seen female faculty sexually harassed by male faculty; never with consequences. I've seen strong female leaders marginalized. I've experienced having my work attributed to others and having my work erased while men doing the same task are recognized and rewarded. I've seen powerful men at conferences behave as drunken boors toward female colleagues and graduate students. I've really had enough. I don't want to ""punish,"" but hope that by acknowledging the harm we can all make academe a more civil and respectful space."male,social&humanities,Small Liberal Arts College,"In a literature class, an older male professor asked women during class whether they_验d ever been sexually harassed in academia. Most of us were uncomfortable and unsure how to answer. He kept asking the question, insisting that he did not think sexual harassment occured at our university. Some of us finally answered that we had witnessed, heard about, or experienced sexual harassment on campus (professors making comments about women_验s bodies and appearances, unwanted touching, etc.), but kept it general because of the classroom setting we were in. One of my colleagues in class had experienced harassment, making this conversation very awkward and personal. All of the men were staring at the women with disbelief, waiting for us to share personal details of trauma. After we shared vague and anonymous accounta, the professor looked incredulous and proceeded to question whether our experiences had really occurred. I think he was genuinely in disbelief, but somehow didn_验t realize that he was contributing to the problem. This professor also routinely made comments in class about undergraduate students_验 bodies and clothing. Another _岩celebrity_ literature professor told students in class that women tend to be smart or pretty, and rarely both. He treated women who dressed in more feminine clothing much differently in class than other women. He would rush to assist them with simple tasks and comment on how nice they looked. "male,social&humanities,NotAvailable,"1. Undergrad: I took many grad seminars, and one male grad student briefly stalked me during and after class, and made me feel very uncomfortable. Another male grad student picked up on what was happening and did the best he could to block the stalker when possible. I discussed this with my then boyfriend (now spouse), and remained vigilant. The incident was brief, and ended once the semester was over. 2. Grad: Upon entering grad school, I was surprised by how sexism is rampant.There was an odd expectation that because we were peers at a prestigious institution, I would welcome the attention of these men. They asked no questions about whether or not I was in a relationship (I was, and am now happily married). They just projected their desires onto me, making sure that nothing was sexually overt enough for me to report or complain about. The sad and pathetic thing is that if these men treated me like a human being, these incidents would have just been a matter of one individual expressing interest in another individual. Of course, they would have been rejected. a) I met a prospective cohort member at a visiting weekend for potential candidates. He seemed oddly interested in the fact that I was younger than him. Later, when he found out that we were both going to the same program (different school from the visit), he sent me an unsolicited email about how he can show me around town, because he had lived there before as a visiting student. He tried to find every reason to talk to me, and even went as far as to pretend that I ""dropped"" my books in the library, by taking them out of my tote bag when I wasn't looking. I kept on ignoring him when he would try to catch my attention. b) I had one classmate pretend to be a gentleman by letting me go ahead through a doorway to the stairs. The staircase is wide enough for two people to climb at once, and was empty, but he stayed behind me the whole time, staring at my calves. I was wearing a long-sleeve sweater, knee-length skirt and low-heeled pumps. We went three flights of stairs like this. Later, he sent me an unsolicited and very poorly written email about a random event at the local library screening a documentary. I didn't respond. Later, he tried to make me talk to him by charging his books to my carrel - it was by pure coincidence that I intercepted the delivery before it was made.c) An advanced grad student whom I had never met before, called me by my name in our department lobby and introduced himself to me. It was only after that I realized that I had never once said my name - so how did he know who I was and how I looked? Afterwards he tried to keep saying hello to me, and I would ignore him. d) When I did my fieldwork abroad, I had lunch with my faculty sponsor and was introduced to an advisee. I found it odd that student would only talk to me when the professor left to pay for the lunch or use the restroom, but thought that perhaps he was being very polite (not uncommon given the local culture). After lunch he asked me where I lived. An email he sent to me indicated that he had no idea what my research topic was, and he offered me his years-long research on what he assumed was data that I wanted and needed. I politely informed him of my research in my reply, and he did not email me back. We've to interact at conferences, but since he found out about my engagement and eventual marriage, he has stopped talking to me unless it is out of pure necessity. There have been many other instances of male grad students staring at me, trying to touch me or touching me without consent, and generally treating me like fresh meat, rather than a colleague. These male grad students are worse than undergraduate men. 3. I'm glad that I've only had two instances where a professor or someone senior in my field has harassed me. a. A visiting professor kept suggesting that I modify my research trajectory, making references to his past relationship to someone who was in my field. When I was getting food at a reception he said: ""Well you don't have to worry about what you eat.... (looking at me up and down)....because you're fit."" b. The worst thing that has happened to me, which pales in comparison to the horrors that others have experienced, was perpetrated by a retired curator from a foreign country. As I was carrying a tray full of tea through a short corridor, he put his arm around my waist and his hand on my hip. It was brief - 20 seconds at most. I was an intern in the presence of many important people, and could not do anything bar dropping the tray and making a scene. The incident disturbed and upset me. "male,social&humanities,Other R1,"My MSc advisor verbally abused and sexually harassed me, sometimes in front of undergraduates in the lab. My lack of smiling displeased him so he would take me outside and walk me around the campus, berating me (probably so no one in the dept could hear him), telling me I was a nothing and a nobody and by letting me in his lab he was doing me a huge service and I should treat him better since it was a privilege for me to be there. After the move to the new place where I didn't know anyone and was being berated, I went to a psychiatrist and was prescribed some medication. It made me sleep all the time and my progress slowed. I finally decided I should talk to my advisor because of this to let him know what was going on. I didn't tell him he was part of the problem. However, he was not sympathetic, made fun of me, and I left his office in tears. I was blamed for anything that ever went wrong in the lab, even if it wasn't my fault. Sometimes this would lead to me having to dig through the hazmat to find samples that I'd thrown away because they didn't work so he could double check they didn't work (they didn't). He once told me that when he saw my face he heard a ""giant sucking sound, a void."" I didn't know much as a first year grad student, but when I would ask questions I as berated with things like, ""How could you possibly not know that?"" He threw rocks at me in the field, made me keep working/hiking when I was pretty badly injured one day, would yell at me if I made his food wrong (once he made me watch him make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich so he could show me how it was done). He made fun of/commented on how I dressed/looked, often. He hit the back of my seat in the car because I changed the radio station. Then the worst, the things that would make me cringe and freeze. Telling me which grad students in the dept he thought were cute. Once when he opened the freezer some things of mine fell out and rolled under it. He shut the door and walked away. I asked him if he was going to pick them up and he said, ""No, I want to watch you bend over."" Once, in the car with a male undergraduate, he told him to ""Look at [my name's] tits. Look how dirty they are!"" because we had been working outside and on the ground."male,social&humanities,Other Type of School,"A male faculty fired me from a school production on the third day of a five month process, despite the fact the videos taken showed that everyone was making mistakes, and I was keeping up with them. During the class he ignored me and was dismissive even when I stood directly in front of him. He called me over to his car in the parking lot and fired me in the parking lot despite the fact that he was not the professor in charge of our class. During the class he begged for volunteers to help him teach the high school students their part of the production. And after he fired me for not being good enough, he then told me he wanted me to help him teach the high school students which meant being alone with him after hours. He originally wanted 60 dancers, but very few people showed up to the audition so he committed himself to accepting student dancers at all levels, and then he backed out of the obligation as quickly as possible. Despite taking dancers from 6 schools, he began with less than half the dancers he wanted. I was told by the dancer he favored that people were dropping from the production like flies in the first week. In the end, he less than 1/3 of the dancers he wanted due to mutual disrespect and open harassment. There was no reason for this man to seek me out alone in a parking lot and ask me to teach the other students what he decided I could not do for myself. If his motives were pure then he shouldn't have been in a rush to fire me. I do believe he wanted me to feel jealous and to sleep with him for the part. "male,NotAvailable,Other R1,"The experience I disclose occurred over a 5 year period. It began my junior year in college when I took a course in the fall and another in the spring semester with a professor. I was a philosophy major but deeply drawn to his line of thinking and decided to take a third course in the spring of my senior year. When I mentioned that to him he suggested instead an independent study in rhetoric and I was to meet with him weekly. We did so, not in his well lit office shared with a colleague but in different locations in a dimly lit theater. Over that year I was essentially seduced. The year between my graduation (magna cum laude in history and philosophy), he suggested we could meet to talk which we did frequently. I think I was looking for mentoring, however one thing led to another and the relationship became not only professor-student, but also sexual. The next year I was a philosophy graduate student at a local university and the relationship continued with him pressing me to follow him to another university as a graduate student and his side paramour. He was 14 years my senior and I had a boy friend and was distraught over the pressure and conflict about life goals. Eventually I chose to marry my boy friend and entered graduate school in a different city. I did, in light of this relationship, change my graduate training discipline from philosophy to rhetoric and earned a Ph.d. in that field and published and became full professor in that field. Coming apart from that relationship and salvaging my marriage was the worst time in my life. Thankfully I succeeded on both accounts. As I look back, it seems to me that I was looking for mentoring in a profession, but the professor expected a quid pro relationship in exchange. This occurred from 1967-1972 : )"male,social&humanities,Elite Institution/Ivy League,Two days after returning to college after my mother's funeral I had a delayed meeting with a professor to discuss my essay and he used my vulnerability at that time to 'comfort' me with unwanted sex.male,social&humanities,Other R1,"I shared an office with folks in this other geophysics group. The prof in charge of that group put the only women in his group in my office so that my office would be a women's only office and all the men of his group would be in their own office. The prof would routinely comment on the perfume worn by the sole female student. In one group meeting, he singled her out in front of the rest of the group and told all the other men to go up and sniff her perfume. She wound up walking out of that group meeting and returning to our office really upset. Meanwhile, one of the male students (in the men's only office) wanted to paint their office walls purple. None of the other students really cared, so he had it painted purple. The prof then proceeded to make a lot comments to him, and to the rest of the people both in that office and in my office, about how purple is not a masculine color, how it is very feminine, etc, that a man shouldn't like purple. It was an open secret in the department that women shouldn't work with this professor or have him as their advisor. An undergraduate student told me he was a nice man, and the example she used to prove this was that when they were doing field work, he brought his prostitute and her son to the group dinner."male,natural,Elite Institution/Ivy League,"We were in a remote location doing field work. I was the only female student. There was a woman prof and a woman postdoc, but english was their second languages so we didn't really speak much. Anyway, most of the group were male French scientists. When I arrived, the lead said to me, ""You are ---? I thought you would be a boy."" That same PI proceeded to make a lot of comments to be about how hard field work is for a woman, how hard it is for women to use the bathroom outside, etc. At our field site, before dinner but after our day of work, I went for a run. When I got back the others were eating so I joined them. The PI then said to me, ""You shouldn't be in running shorts around professors."" (One of the professors was also wearing shorts-- that prof actually came up and apologized to me because he was embarrassed about the PI's behavior). He made me change into pants. A few days later, I was with the woman postdoc and one of the other French scientists. We found an amazing sample and the French man said, ""Wow! This sample should be help by a woman in a calendar of naked women!"" I was shocked/offended that that was what he chose to say to describe the excitement of the find. These are just some examples of what that trip was like."male,social&humanities,Other Type of School,"The chair of my PHD committee began to send me inappropriate texts about meeting him and asking me at places other than his office and asking me when I ""was ready"" to move forward in our relationship"male,NotAvailable,Small Liberal Arts College,"In 2003 when I was a graduate student at the University of Nebraska Lincoln, in the Department of English, I attended a seminar session held at a professor's home. The professor was well regarded in his field, and this final class session was meant to conclude the semester's classes. He cooked and baked for the class--a small group of 3-5 students. At a point midway through the dinner, I went from the table to kitchen to get more water and he came up behind me, pressed himself against me, held me against him so that I could feel his erection. He kissed my neck and placed his hands on me. I froze in the moment but then pulled away. He didn't speak during this episode. I tried to leave as soon as possible, feigning some excuse.

My boss was the PI on a number of research grants and my job was to help him with by doing some statistical analysis on his projects. He would ask me to hang out with him outside of work and I would always say no. For example, he asked me to go to happy hour with him once. Another time he asked me to attend a book signing with him. When I said no, he would punish me by not talking to me. We were the only ones in the office suite together. He once asked me into his office and told me that the moment he met me he felt that we had a very special connection with one another. It made me extremely uncomfortable and I told him that I was very busy and had a lot of friends - and therefore I did not have time to spend it outside of work with him. After awhile I grew so uncomfortable with him that I quit. He insisted that we have an exit interview and wanted me to meet him at the student union by the lake. When I did, he asked me ""what would you say if I asked you out?"" My response was, ""Are you asking me out"" and he would counter with, ""No. I asking you what would you say if I did?"" He was very sneaky that way. I was so upset and talked to him about our unequal power dynamics and that I needed his reference to get another RAship someday. He shrugged it off and said that he would give me a good reference even if I turned him down. I left the ""exit interview"" shaking.

Made me cry after one particularly aggressive incident and then stated I should be fired when I told another professor what happened. Repeatedly threatened my career and grad school application every time I tried to stop behavior. Threatened a medical trainee who stuck up for me once and told my professor to leave me alone at a work dinner where he openly harassed me.

"male,applied&formal,Small Liberal Arts College,"In 2011, I was tasked with observing an adjunct's class in order to evaluate her teaching. I got there a couple minutes late and slipped in the back, taking a seat amongst the students. Because of my late and discrete arrival, most of the students were unaware a professor was sitting amongst them. During the lecture, I found myself distracted by the laptop screen of a student in the next row and one seat up. He was perusing a website of nothing but photos of scantily clad female models in bathing suits, lingerie, and less. At the break, I asked for his name, told him I was a professor, told him that what he was doing was inappropriate, and demanded that he knock it off. He did. After the class, I informed the professor, then my department chair, who encouraged me to follow up with other administrative offices. The three of us agreed that this was inappropriate classroom behavior. However, convincing other University officials of that proved impossible. I spoke with an administrator in the Dean of Students office who accused me of ""getting emotional"" and refused to take the issue seriously. He agreed to speak with the student, but I actually asked him not to. I realized that having someone who didn't think this was an issue and who couldn't refrain from undermining me would only make the situation worse. I also spoke with the head of our Title IX/EEOC office, who incidentally moved on to George Washington University and, according to the Washington Post, is now getting sued for not addressing a harassment complaint. That guy said there was no policy that prevented the student from doing what he was doing. He also was solely concerned about the University's liability, not amending the student's behavior, not on fixing University policy, and not the effect on the other students in the class. As in, he literally didn't care about the actual hostile environment created by the student's porn browsing habit, just that I had reported it as required! (The class was overwhelmingly male. How are female students supposed to feel comfortable participating in class if they have to watch their male peers look at porn?) I ended up dropping the whole thing in disgust. I later learned that other, more enlightened universities actually use this example in seminars about how to identify sexual harassment. What the student did was no different than putting a poster of a naked woman up in an office. He created a hostile work environment for every female student who could see his screen. But, getting the administrators at my University to see that proved impossible."male,social&humanities,Other R1,"During AY 1994-95 (after announcing my divorce), I was harassed, stalked and assaulted by my boss over a period of several months of employment.

I finally settled the case out of court under the condition that I did not pursue it further. (I was living alone w/my two small children.)

This professor had been my undergraduate advisor and mentor (and chair of my undergrad thesis). The first instance occurred during my first semester as a graduate student at a different university. Two female friends of mine (who were still students at the University where the professor taught) and I were hanging out with the professor and a few other (male) professors and former students of his from different institutions at the hotel bar. He was buying my friends and I drinks and had clearly had a few himself before we showed up. Pretty soon the other people we were with left for the night and it was just my two friends and I with the professor drinking and catching up. Pretty soon the conversation turned sexual, with the advances very pointedly directed at me. There was no touching (this time), but the comments were very sexual, and he even insinuated that I should go up to his room with him instead of with my two friends who I was rooming with. It was completely unexpected since this professor never made any remotely sexual passes at me while I was his student. None of us knew how to react except to laugh it off. The next day he approached me and apologized ""if"" he had been inappropriate the night before and blamed it on the alcohol. The last night of the conference we ended up outside the hotel smoking with a group of maybe 10-15 professors and grad students from various universities. He was very drunk again and came up to drunkenly apologize again, but insisted that he hold my hand while doing so. After this conference I began to doubt myself and question if the A's I earned in his classes, the letters of recommendation he wrote, and the research opportunities I had with him were only given to me because he had sexual/romantic feelings for me and not because of my merit as a scholar. Two years later at the same conference I confronted him about the incident (I had seen him a few times since, but it had been kind of awkward and I tried to keep my distance). We had both been drinking, but him especially. He told me that he ""loved me in many ways"" but that he would never give me recommendations or opportunities I didn't deserve based on my abilities. I believed him and I felt that we had reached some sort of resolution with the whole thing. Then, a bit later that night he went to two female friends I had been with during the first incident and propositioned them to come up to his room with him to keep him company. That sense of resolution immediately went out the window. After the conference he contacted me to apologize. I insisted that he also reach out to my two friends and apologize to them, which he did. I haven't seen him much since, and I think things will always be a little awkward between us.

In the email he professed his love for me, saying he wanted to leave his wife for me and that I couldn't tell anyone. As my advisor, he held my future in his hands...

She sent it to some department at the university that was supposed to handle those kinds of issues and recommended I did the same. I did, but never heard back about the incident. They never investigated or responded to my email. My labmate had a feeling it was sent by the postdoc who had recently been fired. He preyed on us as female students in an attempt to get my advisor fired.

He drank with the students frequently, and at one of our stops we had two cabins rented: one for men and one for women, and he insisted on staying in the women's cabin, ""for protection"". He spent that time walking around in his underwear and drinking. A few times when we were taking group pictures, he would put his hand on my butt and squeeze, but there was no way to tell him to stop without making a scene in front of everyone, including other professors. I felt that he was more or less acting in creepy ways, and had discussed this with other students, but two of us had gotten food poisoning and while we were sick he made a point to take care of us. Then, both of us felt really guilty about labeling him a creep, and both decided to give him another chance. At another location, he asked me to come with him to get some food and wine from his cabin to bring back for the rest of the class, and while we were getting it, he started rubbing my shoulders, and I made an excuse to go.

He made sure that my file was always hidden on his desk. No one else could touch my file. They couldn't even find it. It was normal procedure for me to be forced to wait there for up to 2 hours while they fiddled around looking for my file, called my professors to make sure I could take the class, emailed them and insisted I wait for an email response, and whatever else they were doing. I always had permission to be in the class from the professors and the VA doesn't care what classes I take, so long as this is an accreditted college.

The head of the VA department for CCBC did not care that I was being sexually harassed or that I was forced to wait 2 hours at the Veterans desk at the finance office. He wasn't listening and was instead angry that I refused to go to his frat party where alcohol was served. He then insisted that I was mentally ill for using the adult words, ""CYA"" and ""BS.""

He never brought up writing, publishing, books, art, or my goal of being a picture book author/illustrator, which had been the entire point of the meeting. Instead he only asked me questions about my personal life.

I recoiled just before he could, and when he noticed how uncomfortable I was he tried to pass off his physical advance as just going in for a hug (""What? I just wanted to embrace you"", he said). I awkwardly got out of the car, went up to my dorm room, and called my boyfriend. I was extremely shaken and upset.

This camera - a ""spy"" pen - had purportedly been in the bathroom for weeks, at least. No one in the department was made aware of the situation when he was caught. To this day, many of my colleagues believe he left to pursue a better position. The perpetrator was quietly forced to resign, with no criminal charges brought against him.

I was awakened to phone call with a creepy whispering voice to ""look out my window"". I was frightened and called campus security instead. When they arrived, they searched the window from the outside and found the sexually explicit ""artwork"". They did not find the perpetrator. I then called a male friend for support and heard laughter. He was with 3 or 4 buddies. I had no idea that someone I considered a friend would do something so aggressive. And he did it in tandem with other men. "male,social&humanities,NotAvailable,"I had just submitted my PhD. supervisor was off sick, and so i got statistical help from another staff member. After i submitted myself and a few friends decided to celebrate. This staff member's (SG) office was next to mine, so when i saw him i invited him along. He came. When we were there he wanted to sit inbetween me and my friend. We were both hesitant about this because it meant we were all sitting very close together but felt we could not say No to this.At the end of the evening our male friend suddenly dashes off and everyone else leaves, leaving us girls alone with SG. She asks me to walk her back to her campus room because SG had been stroking her back and feeling her bra strap. I walked my friend back. When i went to go home SG propositioned me for a physical relationship for 45 minutes, and he wanted to walk me back home.My friend made an anoymous complaint about him, but i think he thinks i did it. My friend later co-authored a paper with him, whilst i cut all ties with him.Everyone knows he is the creepy guy, but he never gets sacked.

Just before the meeting he contacted me telling him to meet me in town and he'll buy me dinner. I thought this was weird but thought ok.... and i went.We went to dinner....it was like a date. He insisted on walking me home. I said it was not necessary but he kept insisting. When we got outside my house i could see where this was leading, so i played dumb like i didn't know and went inside my house.He also asked me at the dinner not to tell my PhD supervisor about this because she gossips.We didn't speak after that despite being in the same Department.

He told me ""a bunch of people"" were getting together to do homework together at a cafe, but when I got there, it was just him. He told me he had already done the homework and implied I should copy from him (I didn't). He asked me if I was still with ""that guy"" (my boyfriend of 4 years who I was living with, and he knew that). I left and tried to avoid him from then on. However, we were TAing together so I couldn't always avoid him. When I did see him, he would find ways to touch me (laugh at a joke and punch my shoulder, put his arm around me like we were best buddies, etc.) I felt uncomfortable speaking up about it because it was only a few weeks into the first semester of classes, and I was still trying to make friends with other students (who were almost all male). This was in a physics department with very few female students, and it seemed the department had organized it so the female students were evenly distributed among the TA groups. They probably meant well by this but it meant I was the only woman around most of the time. I tried to avoid events with this person at them, including skipping class for a few weeks and avoiding social events. When I tried to get back into social events, I found myself at a table with myself and 9 male students discussing whether men and women had statistically different aptitudes for physics. They weren't amused by my suggestion that measurements of these aptitude differences perturb the system and affect the result (stereotype threat). They also weren't amused by my suggestion that the error bars are much much larger than the effect that they were interested in measuring. I gave up on making friends with other graduate students from my cohort after that."both,social&humanities,Other Type of School,"Domestic violence committed by a male graduate student in my department. Over a period of several months, this person stalked me, physically assaulted me, and threatened to kill me on and off the university's campus. When I tried to leave him, he made a suicide attempt in the department that was explicitly aimed at me, which culminated in his being forcibly removed and briefly detained in a psychiatric ward. The next day, he was back in the department, with a public sympathy campaign intended to silence me and others who knew about his history of violent and threatening behavior. The university took no action; as far as I'm aware, none of the faculty who were aware of his abuse reported it. After learning extensive details of the case, his (female) faculty patron continues to support and protect him.

I move again and again, eventually just gave up and left. Several other instances of lack of respect for boundaries (physical) and sexualized comments.

Later I discovered that at least 5 other women staff have had similar experiences, and some have made formal complaints to HR. "male,NotAvailable,Other R1,"It was well known that he had had affairs with students before, the age gap between him and his wife made that apparent. We assumed that this was why the girls, they were always girls, who he invited into his inner circle were overwhelmingly queer. He was brilliant and respected and his letters of recommendation were rumored to remain unfinished until they made his wife cry. I babysat his children, did yard work, and bartended his parties. He used to take me to concerts, operas, and plays - just the two of us. He waited until just after I had graduated before he tried to kiss me, while his kids were in the other room. I ducked and made a hasty exit. He was invited to my graduation party, schmoozed with my friends and family, shook my father's hand, and then called me 6 times after he had left to ask if I had really meant it when I said 'love you' to him and his family as they left. He refused me feedback on my final paper unless we could 'go over it one on one' and sent me late night texts about how he missed me and wish we could slip away or travel to italy together. It shook me because he was my mentor throughout college, and I realized that he wasn't grooming me because he thought I was talented or capable, but because he wanted to sleep with me.

"male,social&humanities,Other R1,"My friend is a very modest woman. She is a bigger girl and often has a hard time finding clothes that fit appropriately particularly for her upper half. She usually wears extra large/baggy t-shirts, but when at department events/conferences she tries to dress more professionally. We were attending a multi-department function with 50+ people. My friend was wearing a women's suit with a shirt underneath. A tiny bit of her cleavage was showing (less than an inch-which is amazing given her size). She was really self conscious about it and I assured her that she looked great and that things would be fine. We walked into the event and the chair of my department immediately approached her. He said in public ""That's a really low-cut shirt you have there. We don't usually see you in something that is so suggestive to men."" He smiled as he said it. She turned red, smiled and froze. The chair chuckled, turned and walked away. My friend was so upset by the comment that she quickly turned and left. I left with her. She had to meet with the chair a few weeks later and he made another comment after seeing her enter his office in a baggy t-shirt. ""I thought you would wear that professional low-cut number you wore the other night."" She proceeded to make suggestive comments for the next few weeks every time he saw her. I watched as she changed her hours for being on campus to avoid him, missed department functions etc. Given the climate at Michigan State University and how professors, administrators, athletics is protected she didn't want to say anything, but as I watched her get further and further depressed, self conscious etc. I knew I had to do something. At the time, I was the top graduate student in the department. I had the most publications, awards, etc. I reported the incident to a professor, who reported it through the proper channel. Nothing happened to the chair. Nothing. He remained the chair until his contract was up. He is still a professor in the department. The professor I reported it to experienced retaliation. I felt horrible about this. The next semester I lost all of my funding from the department. Completely confused by this, I contacted the chair and was told ""sometimes other people out perform you."" When I showed him my record having more publications than any other student, more awards etc. and asked how I could drop from #1 to below #30 in less than a semester, he refused to answer and only said ""our decision process is confidential."" I reported this retaliation and nothing happened. I continued to experience retaliation until I graduated in various forms.

Apart from mansplaining English to us (he was not a native speaker - either of the language we were learning or speaking - but somehow knew more about colloquial English than we did) he was also overly familiar with the women in the class. He mentioned frequently how his now-wife had once been a favorite student. He soon started focusing more on me, being effusive about my translations (I know they were terrible, and looking back his attempt at grooming was pathetic), which simultaneously garnered the ill will of the rest of the class. In an effort to stop it I stayed home from class one day without notifying him - the next time I attended class I was dressed down in front of everyone, since he ""had no idea if I was alive or dead and would it have taken that much effort to let him know I was going to be absent). I was more or less dead to him after that, which suited me fine, although I still get LinkedIn requests. "male,social&humanities,Other R1,"I was disappointed that this person had let me down as someone I trusted. Explicit messages from this person for a month have resulted in me feeling isolated and uncomfortable. I feel even shameful, as I worry that I led this person on.

"NotAvailable,social&humanities,Other Type of School,"For women students of my generation (this happened in the mid 80s) and probably others that followed, he was known as *** ""***."" Although ***could be an informative and stimulating teacher, he was a nightmare for female students. Case in point: I lived on Capital Hill in those days, and one evening after class *** saw me waiting at the bus stop and offered me a ride in his old Volvo. I still remember our avuncular conversation, *** gabbing away about collecting license plates. When we reached Broadway, I was suddenly mashed against the door as *** accosted me in an unwelcome embrace, complete with tobacco-stained kiss. I tumbled onto the street, my dignity in tatters. At the next class, *** appeared unfazed, likely knowing I would brush the incident under the rug, which I did. (This was 1986 - there was no forum for reporting horny old profs. You simply hid behind a tree if you saw a Volvo cruising past the bus stop.) If it were only a case of horny old prof syndrome, I wouldn't be writing this. However, *** put his money where his mouth was. He announced in class it was his policy to never give female students a 4.0. And he didn't. I had a 4.0 GPA going into 19th Century British Lit, the penultimate course in my college career; I was shocked to emerge with a 3.8. (I still have a wonderful paper on Mansfield Park that Roger made me revise three times. Because apparently that's what women need to do.) Since mine was a terminal degree (MFA), I wasn't professionally affected by ***'s policy (as far as I know), but several women going for a doctorate needed a certain grade point average, and were rightly outraged by ***'s ""policy."" We all signed a petition and took it to the dean. Of course, nothing happened--not to *** ***, and not for many of us going forward, either. For men of ***'s generation, lovely young grad students were the coin of the realm. For women of my generation, whose lives and careers were dented if not blighted by these old goats, it was a very different story. "male,social&humanities,Other Type of School,"Prof X and I had a working relationship which I thought was just like the working relationship he had with other MA and PhD students. I knew that he tended to have favourites - mostly men - and I just thought that I was one of them. He would invite groups of us to his house for dinner, and we would all go to the pub together after classes. It was an intellectually stimulating and friendly environment. The fact that there were a number of others that he showed similar levels of attention to made me assume that he was just treating me in the same way. I was friendly and informal with him, and I trusted him, I even talked to him about the impact that family troubles had had on me personally.After one of the dinners, he sent me a text message saying 'you are so beautiful, what is a boy to do?' At this point I had started a relationship with one of the PhD students in the group, which he and everybody in the group knew about. We had had a lot to drink that evening, and so I just ignored the message. I thought of it as a strange but ultimately innocent comment that one of my father's friends might say after too many whiskies (Prof X is older than my father). After that the comments became more frequent. It was confusing because at this point I had known him for several years, I had worked for him, I had had coffee with him to discuss work, and I had been to many many gathering where there were lots of MA and PhD students who were all very relaxed and chatty with the faculty members. This meant that I didn't see how inappropriate some of the things he was saying were. It quickly escalated to the point where in the pub at the end of term, just before several deadlines, and I was about to start my dissertation, he grabbed my arm and confessed feelings for me in front of my partner (the PhD student), and a couple of others at the table. I pulled my arm out of his grip and said something along the lines of 'that's very nice but I don't see you in that way', and left with my partner. I thought that that would be the end of it. The next day he posted a package through my letter box containing earrings, a card, and a cd 'mixtape' he'd made for me. I was gobsmacked. I was already shocked by what had happened the night before, but thought I had made it clear that I wasn't interested in him in that way. I had arranged to go away for the holiday break that day, and left without saying anything to anybody about it. After a few days Prof X sent me a message asking if I'd received the present and if I liked it. I said 'they're nice but I'm very shocked', he replied 'What! Shocked! I thought I'd made my feelings clear! You give the most seductive looks', I replied that 'I'd never seen him as anything other than a teacher, mentor and friend'. The next day he sent an apologic message, and asked if he could come to see me to talk things though, I said 'no' and that I didn't want any contact from him. Eventually we met, and I told him I wasn't going to report it, he seemed happy about that. Following this he continued to make inappropriate comments at times, and to put cards in my inbox, but it happens much less frequently now that I am married, and I avoid him as much as possible. He refused to help me with my PhD application, and prior to the main incident, when I still went to him for advice about academic things he was actively discouraging me from following up opportunities with other faculty members (I discuss this more below).It was a very strange situation, and initially I felt sorry for him, and that it was my fault, I had, after all, been friendly with him for years, and I ignored the initial messages, but now I see that his actions were calculated and wildly inappropriate given the age difference, and the academic power imbalance, and I am, frankly, furious.

I was confident that I could stay enrolled and complete all the coursework for the 2 required courses for my program so as not to fall behind. I had the support to do this through university policy as well as the chair of my department and my dissertation advisor. I made it a point to meet in advance with the professors teaching the required courses to talk to them about how this would be managed. As a first year student, I did not know these professors. When I met with one of the professors and told him that I was pregnant but that I was confident I could keep up with the work in his class his response was: ""Do you know who knocked you up or is this a bastard child?"" I was completely shocked by this response, gave a nervous laugh, and repeated that I wanted to stay enrolled in his class. And his response the second time was ""Okay, whatever floats your boat.""

I witnessed some of this behavior myself. I confided in my chair, an older woman, who told me ""Men have their needs"" and refused to believe me or use her social capital to intervene.

I messaged this person the next day explaining I was not interested especially given we are coworkers and he apologized. We continued to work and occasionally socialize so I came to trust this person. Several months later at another party when I was leaving (sober and early) I was saying goodbye when he grabbed me, kissed me, and asked me to stay over with him. I was leaving the party early because it was three days before my masters qualifying exam, which he knew. I was immensely stressed and left crying. I felt deeply disrespected and violated by this colleague. I felt distracted from focusing on my exam (which could determine if I would stay in the program). I felt a huge burden that reporting would have consequences for him that I wasn't sure I wanted to set off so I decided to message him and set my foot down again, he apologized and said it wouldn't happen again.

I asked him if I got in and he said he hadn't decided yet. He told me that I had taken the wrong exam and my scores were borderline.

I felt glad that I didn't entirely understand what was happening at the time. I hadn't heard of sexual harassment or quid per quo.

My frustration was compounded by another female instructor who would flirt with him and even breast fed her child bare breasted in a meeting between the three of us well knowing she would turn him on and make me uncomfortable. For a while I tolerated his antics, then I began to tell him his commentary made me feel uncomfortable, eventually I got so pissed that I said to him, ""I am beginning to feel sexually harassed"" . I hadn't gotten to the point of reporting him but I was primed. He retired within a few months of my saying that to him. Oh!

He/would her into his office in private and use that as an opportunity to ask her to be physically intimate with him or touch her or invade her personal space inappropriately. Of all the female grad students, he only took it that far with her and while at this point it is pure speculation on my part, it seemed he was taking advantage of the fact that she was quiet and reserved and infrequently socialized with others in her cohort. The worst part about this is that others, who in similar situations would speak us agains such transgressions dismissed his behavior as simply a product of his upbringing in a different country combined with a bit of senility as he was close to retiring.

In a separate incident, he grabbed my hand and started sucking on my fingers before I retracted them, horrified."male,social&humanities,Elite Institution/Ivy League,"(1) About a decade and a half ago a number of female students started to come to my office asking how to make sense of the fact that two of our male faculty students (one full, another assistant TT), were dating graduate students. I was one of a handful of women tenured in my department. I brought up the incident with my chair and he appointed me, together with two other colleagues (both of them my seniors, one male and one female), to deal with this. we had meetings with grad students, discussions, meetings. another female grad. student came to me confidentially to complain about another male senior faculty member dating graduate students. i made a big stink about it in the department and as a result i was identified as a bully, a McCarthy-like figure, and someone to avoid. One single person, another woman full professor (she was not on the committee appointed to deal with this) defended me publicly. other women kept coming into my office and virtually holding my hand as to how awful it was that i had to deal with this. (2) a prospective female faculty member was repeatedly disrespected by senior faculty members, who refused to refer to this candidate as ""Dr."" and instead calling her ""Ms."" in the documentation forwarded to the department and discussions in the department. The other candidates, all of whom were male, were just ""Dr."" One senior male faculty member insinuated in this and other ways that were not about the substance of her work that this person was not qualified for a position in our department. I called him on it in a department meeting, he stopped, but there was no other senior colleague in the department who stood up for this person publicly. I again got some private ""thank you's"", but that was the end of the discussion.(3) a senior female colleague has told female students directly that if they get pregnant, they need to have an abortion. she also let another male senior colleague know that she considered no longer writing letters for a female grad student when that person had a child."male,social&humanities,Other R1,"I was in my second year of my PhD program and I was raped by the postdoc in my lab.

Opening line of discussion? An extended discourse on the senior woman in the department's breasts. Shortly after, a male grad student gently ""let me know"" that I was a topic of similar commentary at said professor's ""poker nights"" (which consisted of the professor and the department's male grad students.) The grad student wanted me to ""watch out,"" though I was at a loss as to what to do as the most junior member of the department.

I explained that I was not interested and he apologized - I was happy to put this down to genuine misreading of signals and agreed that I hoped to continue a cordial professional relationship and forget this had happened. But then he started to behave oddly, sending me letters and gifts, telling me off privately if I appeared nervous in his presence because people might think something strange was going on (as though I should be complicit in covering it up). He then made another pass at me and said that because I had continued being 'friendly' at subject-events he assumed I was interested. He made me feel that I had been leading him on, that I'd done something wrong, I began to feel very stressed and uncomfortable in my workplace, always worried I might bump into him. The following year I found out that the same person had harassed a friend of mine who had got a fixed-term job at the same institution. A few years after that (after I had left) I heard from another female acquaintance who worked there after me that he had also harassed her.

In 2014, my lawyer was successful in organizing a mediation with the church and I received a modest settlement. But the late Professor Freda Briggs warned me I would have more trouble with the University of Queensland, and this has proven to be the case. It is now a year since, in the glare of the Australian Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse (I was a child of 17 at the time of the abuse), the University finally agreed to investigate. But they are dragging their heels. In 2002 an article appeared in the media following comments former Archbishop Hollingworth made in relation to my case. The article was seen by the son of a 12 year old victim of the same man, who died after disclosing her abuse to her son. His vocation as a priest, marriage, and health, have been destroyed by the Church because he made a respectful approach to tell his mother_验s story. In addition, he is the nephew of the former Chancellor of the University, with whom he is furious for the cover up of his mother_验s case. His mother_验s abuse occurred in the 1950s.

She suggested that I should have aborted once I got the job with her, so I could focus on my career. Hilariously, she recounted tales of how she SCUBA-dived when she was a pregnant post-doc, basically saying that she could accomplish research when she was pregnant, but that I wouldn't be capable at doing so. She also gave me unwanted advice, such as getting a C-section was preferable so that I wouldn't wreck myself ""down there"". She gave me this particular advice several times, including on the day I gave birth. She purposefully put up roadblocks to my research (switching goals capriciously), and made it difficult for me to work on my project, and then tried to pin my difficulties on me.

I was later promoted to a midlevel leadership role that ultimately required that I terminate his contract, but I was not permitted to tell him that his dishonesty in disclosing his legal issues/sexual exploitation was why he was not renewed. The fact that a proper background check was not done when this person was hired still fills me with rage, as does the fact that I was not permitted to be clear about why the contract was terminated.

Two students in particular stalked her daily in the school and outside of the building. They learned her class schedule and entered the classroom before and after her classes or stood outside the room during her class. They would loiter near the entrance of the building at the times that her usually arrived or left for the day. When she was not in class, R.W. They never addressed her directly, not even when they were assaulting her, but amongst themselves they referred to her as _岩that fat bitch_ and _岩that bitch_ and _岩dyke._ One of the male students (with encouragement from the other), physically and sexually assaulted her nearly during her 3L school year. He pushed her, lunged at her, choked her, put her in a headlock, shoved his crotch against her, walked up behind her and shoved his crotch against her bottom, punched he in her back, punched her in the back of the head so hard that she had to go home and then hit her in the head again the next day, pulled her arm, pulled her hair, grabbed her clothing, put his hand in her pants or shirt, grabbed her by the belt, approached her in an aggressive manner as if to start a physical altercation with her, cornered her in secluded areas of the building. One night, a group of about of male students watched while two male students attempted to rape the female student. one of them attempted to do so again on other occasions, again, while the other male students watched and did nothing. These male students would stand around her locker everyday in addition to following her around the small. One night, a male student shoved the female student face forward against a locker and repeatedly shoved his crotch against her bottom. This was witnessed by a security guard as well as other students. In fact, the physical and sexual assault occurred in public areas of the law school - classrooms, cafeteria, library, lobby, lounge - and not once did anyone attempt to assist the female student.

I of course gladly agreed that that was a great idea--to not communicate anymore and to leave them alone. I didn't speak to them, vice versa, for about 5-months when the new academic school year began and the professor stalked me and my child on campus (I had to attend an after-hours event and as a single-mom had no choice but to bring baby) where the professor picked the baby up in front of shared colleagues, calling her child, etc. I immediately and finally went to TIX the next day.

I asked my husband what I should do. My husband said, ""I'm having a good time with my uncle. It seems like you have to or should go for a drink, but I don't want to.""I met the male prof at the restaurant. In the lobby, I ran into a former student who was in grad school or at a post-doc at the time [can't remember which]. I tried to get the grad student (or anyone else) to join us, but he had other plans.Over the course of the conversation, the male prof put his hand on my knee and said, ""I'm sensing a mutual attraction."" I said, ""That's a nice compliment, but I'm happily married.""NOTE: I did not want to offend someone who would likely be voting on my tenure. Also, you never know how men will respond to rejection. I have experienced some very hostile responses by men to even the kindest rejection. I was also thinking that this is a simple misunderstanding and (hopefully) not a big deal.

I've got to get back to my husband. It's no big deal.""Then, I got immediately into a cab and left.Afterwards, I spoke about the incident with my husband (that evening) and my dad later (by phone). I was concerned that I had miscommunicated and that I shouldn't have put myself in that situation. They were both clear that a woman should be able to meet with a colleague and not have that experience.I also spoke about this with a senior female colleague inside my department, a female colleague at my same rank, a senior female colleague in other department, and a staff member. The advice was overwhelmingly that there is nothing I can do that will not put my tenure at risk.I am also aware of some undergraduate students who might have been harassed later by the same male professor.My husband, and I usually try to have students over for dinner once a semester. Generally, this is for graduate students, but some of my classes are graduate/undergraduate, and we decided it's not fair to only invite some students.In 2013 (pretty sure it was the spring semester), we had students over for dinner at the end of the semester. We overheard a few of them talking in a side conversation about explicit comments from a professor to a couple of female undergraduates. A male undergraduate was telling the young women, ""that's wrong"" and ""he can't do that."" The male undergraduate was encouraging them to report it. We did not hear the details, but we interjected. I said, ""I'm sorry to interrupt your conversation, but from the little bit that I heard, that is NOT ok. It shouldn't happen to you, and it is NOT your fault."" I also told them that there is not much that I can do as an untenured professor but encouraged them to talk with a female full professor that they trust. They did not want to report it, and I do not believe that they reported it at the time. The only details that I know from those students is that there were ""sexually explicit"" and ""inappropriate"" comments made to at least two female students in class and some inappropriate fb messages to at least one by the same male professor who had harassed me.I feel incredibly guilty about the fact that I did not report the incident that happened to me or what I learned from students in this case. We (faculty and staff) were not trained as mandatory reporters until 2015 or 2016 at my institution. I also feel terrible because I do not think that this has stopped.I should also mention that this male professor voted against me for tenure. My tenure case received unanimous support from the college tenure committee, the Dean, and the Provost's Office because I had a strong case.Initially, I was afraid to talk about this even after tenure because I believed that people might think that I'm just bitter and trying to get revenge. After speaking with several other colleagues, I've realized that actually it's evidence of retribution.I'm submitting this information to you because as a tenured faculty member I have a duty to protect young people from this kind of abuse.

The department was male-dominated and all the men would laugh when he did this. Later there were many more incidents - I had to deal with students who told me they had been sexually assaulted, sexual jokes in faculty meetings, etc etc. This all happened along with male faculty members constantly dismissing my ideas, ignoring me, laughing at me, and generally being patronizing. "male,social&humanities,Other R1,"In July 2017, I had just graduated from the University of Pennsylvania's JD and MBA programs, and I went on a date with a self-professed social justice advocate, Harvard Law graduate, and Democratic Party candidate in the 2016 election who was about to start teaching at Penn Law. We met at a bar, and when it started to empty, he suggested we go to the rooftop of his apartment complex, where many of my friends lived. But the rooftop turned out to be closed, so he suggested we go back to his apartment unit instead (I flagged this, but agreed). An hour later, I told him I was going home, and he kissed me in response. I repeated that I was leaving, and without saying anything, he picked me up, carried me into his bedroom, and pinned me to the bed. I told him I was leaving (3rd time) and tried to push him off of me, but he just continued kissing and lying on top of me without moving. I extricated myself by peeling myself out from underneath him and told him I was leaving (4th time). When I walked to the door to the living room, he grabbed my arm and dragged me back to the bed. He was laughing, because he somehow thought I was flirting with him. I wrenched my arm out of his grasp and went back into the living room to put on my shoes and told him, ""I'm not playing hard-to-get with you. Maybe you think I am. I'm not."" I left. The next morning, he texted me to ask why I had unmatched him on the dating app. He wanted to ""talk."" He called me and said, ""I get the feeling that you were upset at me last night. What happened?"" I yelled at him for 45 minutes about what he did wrong. He had so many excuses. ""But it was late .... and you came to my place ... I thought you were just playing hard-to-get ... But most girls ..."" At the end of our call, he apologized and then had the gall to ask me for a second date because he was ""really disappointed"" about how things turned out. I told all my friends and wrote about it in a public Facebook post that went semi-viral. He currently teaches Law & Candidacy at the University of Pennsylvania Law School."male,social&humanities,Elite Institution/Ivy League,"In a weak moment I (male graduate student, 22) slept with my (several years older) teaching assistant while I was in a relationship. Things went (what I thought was) amicably stale and we discontinued our affair, but when we happened to join the same lab for postdocs, she bullied, ridiculed and harassed me, disclosed our relationship to every lab member and generally created a very unpleasant situation for me. Until very recently I would have not thought of this as sexual harassment (the original incident was consensual, and I am the guy, right?), but following the #metoo stories here and elsewhere closely, it resonated with me that the power dynamic between us was such that I was victimised for not conforming to the expectations of the other party, and that this was abusive. I could not retaliate or get out of the situation, because I was (at the time) still with the same partner that I had been unfaithful to, and knew this was going to be a deal breaker (It was), and disclosure to my partner was explicitly threatened."male,social&humanities,Other R1,"I was groomed and sexually harassed by a professor I admired and trusted. For the first four months of my freshman year, I was the bearer of all his burdens, marital problems, and received 50+ cryptic emails from him alluding to his feelings for me. I was 18 and he was 65, and he made think it was all very normal, that this was how our close-knit community functioned, that professionalism took a back-seat. I attend a small college. He had been teaching there almost since its conception. He was loved by everyone on campus, and I was very flattered that he had taken (what I had originally thought was) an academic interest in me. It was a gradual process, one that I was manipulated to believe was genuine and innocent. Throughout it I has been naive, and he conditioned me to think that interacting in this manner was appropriate. I was happy to receive the attention because he made me believe it was because he saw potential in my interests in Humanities. Fast forwarding through more sickening nonsense, he made a sexual comment toward me in front of everyone at a trustee dinner, including his wife. The next week, I confronted him and told him I didn't want any contact with him anymore. It was a truly terrible and mortifying experience through and through. I was really young and had no idea how to navigate college life, let alone this. For the rest of my freshman year, I worked very hard to avoid him.

I was shocked, said nothing in reply. I was offended but I was na账ve and had no idea this was a sexual harassment back then. 2- I changed academic programs to have a different supervisor. Then I found out what sexual harassment was, so I non-maliciously and naively told about the previous offensive comments to the male prof who is the supervisor of the same program that the female coordinator was in. So two weeks after I told her that if she ever made such a comment about my face, I would complain, I got a phone call from campus police telling me to come talk with them3- Campus police asked me if I was covering the pics of the same program_验s supervisor and if I was sending him gifts, I had no idea that this was even happening. The police officer of campus police kept laughing all the time while he interrogated, which was bizarre, to me it was very serious and not funny at all.4- Proceeded my studies by going to classes and after classes ended I avoided campus altogether due to fear of obliviously, innocently and unknowingly being at the wrong place and at the wrong time and be unjustly falsely accused again of doing things I didn_验t do and knew nothing about. 5- One year before I graduated, I got an e-mail from campus police telling that they had contacted the wrong student and that I hadn_验t done anything wrong.

The colleague had sex with me while I had passed out. When I tried to say the next day that it was not ok, he dismissed me."male,natural,Elite Institution/Ivy League,"A grad was in the final year of completing his dissertation. The professor who was the committee chair went abroad on sabbatical. The large timezone difference made it difficult to keep in touch other than via email. As a way to stay motivated without regular meetings with the chair, the grad turned to a writing support group. The group was mainly other grads, but there was one female assistant professor who hung around the grads. She seduced the grad into letting her ""help"" him publish one of his dissertation chapters, which she told him would be easy to do in a journal edited by a female friend of hers (who some years before had been an associate professor in the department). All she wanted in return was to be the co-author on the article. To be clear, she was not a member of his dissertation committee, had not been involved in the research at any stage, was not a Co-PI on any of the project funding, and was not even in the same discipline (it's a joint department). All she had done was some copy editing and write a new paragraph for the introduction to reorient the research to her field that, unsurprisingly, was entirely unsuited to the research design. The grad naively did as she told him and submitted the manuscript to the journal (with him as first author and her as second) and kept the submission from the committee chair. When he returned from sabbatical, someone else in the writing group told him what was going on. He told the grad that what he was doing with the assistant professor was completely unacceptable, inappropriate, and unethical, and that he must write the editor to withdraw the submission. The grad told the assistant professor and she put up major resistance and even refused to discuss the matter with the committee chair. She was supported by the female editor and another female associate professor in the department with a rumor campaign that the patriarchy was trying to abuse graduate students by poaching their research and that the committee chair was behaving unethically by refusing to allow her to _岩mentor_ the grad. The grad student was distraught, and like many grads quite naive about the ethics of publishing, but after the committee chair pointed out that the assistant professor had not asked the grad to collaborate with her on coauthoring publications deriving from her dissertation, which she was then in the process of trying to publish, he began to see how he had been lured into an extremely unequal and exploitative relationship with a manipulative assistant professor. He remembered that it was the committee chair who had supported and guided his research for many years, intellectually and financially, apologized for his naivete, and began to get back on track with the plan to complete his dissertation. At the same time, he still had a relationship with the female assistant professor that he wanted to maintain. And the assistant professor was intransigent that it was her right to have relationships with grads she was not on the committee of, _岩mentor"" them, and coauthor articles derived from their dissertations. Just as the committee chair was going to report the situation to HR and others, including the journal publisher's legal department, three highly negative reviews came back. Even the conspiring editor could not cover up that degree of rejection. Apparently, wonder of wonders, the reviewers thought the data were excellent but required a completely different analytical approach to become acceptable for publication in their field. With the adulterated manuscript rejected by the reviewers, the female editor used that turn of events as an excuse to withdraw her participation in the plan to poach the grad's research and escape possible repercussions from the journal publisher_验s legal department. With an easy publication no longer in sight, the female assistant professor dropped the grad like a hot potato. The committee chair did not file official complaints with HR or the journal publisher. He wanted to in order to protect other grads from being similarly exploited in future, but ultimately he realized that his primary responsibility was to his current student, who had apologized profusely for his naive behavior. Filing complaints could create future difficulties for the student just as he was starting out on his career. Out of the same fears, the grad also did not file a complaint with HR. So, in the end, the grad did what he should have done in the first place -- he worked with his committee chair to finalize analysis of the data, finished writing the dissertation, graduated, published dissertation chapters in journals, and got a tenure-track position."male,social&humanities,Other Type of School,"I was paired with a teaching mentor to help me develop materials to teach my first two section of freshman English. We had a group meeting and broke off to discuss our materials. After the meeting, my mentor asked me to come back with him to his office in the back of the department. No one else was in the hallway when we walked into his office and he asked me to shut the door behind me. I hesitated but ultimately did what he asked. He asked me to sit down and he began telling me how he intends to be fully available to me as I transition into teaching, which to me, was the entire premise of him being assigned to me as my mentor and did not need to be said to me in private. I never set up a meeting with him again. "male,social&humanities,Other Type of School,"1) Genius-but-troubled senior professor in my department (I was in my mid-20s, he was a white dude in his late 50s) invited me to lunch to ""talk about a project"" in my first year of grad school. Instead, he bragged about his ""crazy"" life and asked me if I had a boyfriend. I lied and said yes (years later I found out he always invited young, non-white female grad students to the same restaurant as a prelude to try to date them). Over the next year or so, he kept up a flirty banter and because he was on my committee and I was writing part of my MA thesis under his supervision, I went along (he had also started openly dating another ""ethnic"" female grad student, younger than me). Then one day, at a party at another faculty member's home, I made a joke and he flipped out: told me to f**k off in front of other grad students, grabbed my arm and shook me. I was shocked but pretended to take it lightly because everyone knew he was ""crazy"". The following week during class he calls me down to his office and proceeds to scream at me for 20 minutes while pacing up and down the office looking furious. He called me a ""spoiled brat"", who the hell did I think I was, etc. It made no sense but I was terrified and thought he was going to hit me. I kept looking at the door to run out. When he finally let me go, I went straight to the common room and burst out crying. My male friends, also grad students, and my male advisor, who was a good mentor but very non-confrontational, all told me to let it go and avoid the guy in the future. I ran into this man in the hallway that same afternoon and he acted like nothing had happened. He ended up on my dissertation committee and used the parts of my MA thesis that I wrote under him as a resource for his own work without ever giving me any credit. Years later, he was suspended for both threatening colleagues and sexual harassment. He is still employed by the university and routinely gets described as ""irreverent"" and ""colorful"" in interviews. He's a jerk. 2) At a post-conference pub night, filled with conference goers, a much older, very senior faculty member corners me to ""talk"" and proceeds to stare at my chest in such a pronounced way that my (male) friend comes over with two beers and stands between the guy and me. My friend pretended I had asked him to get one for me, but he actually did it when he saw my face because I looked so uncomfortable. "male,social&humanities,Other Type of School,"I was at a symposium (a few weeks before graduate school started) with members of the IU Anthropology community. The first night, the professor approached me and asked me to get a drink with him, he insisted on buying the drink. It was just him and I for the majority of the night, and I was super uncomfortable after leaving the hotel bar. The next night, he asked me to go downtown with him and play pool and get drinks with him, to which I declined. Now that I've started graduate school, I see him from time to time and he makes me very uncomfortable. "male,applied&formal,Other R1,"I was an undergraduate doing an independent study (on the philosophy of evil in the writings of Avicenna.) It was emphasized that as an undergraduate I was extraordinarily lucky to have this opportunity. I had to meet privately with the professor. It was a small office. We would sit at his desk and he would keep moving in on me until I was pinned to the wall. He would lean, brush, rub, and touch all the time, with many parts of his body. He doodled pornographic pictures on my notes. He would make odd noises. He set out cushions on the floor and tried to get me to sit there (I wouldn't) and stay the night (I didn't.) He would talk about my looks/body/hair. I usually dressed 'like a boy' in baggy work shirts, sweaters, and jeans anyway but I started wearing more layers and tying my hair up. I was inexperienced and naive. I kept to my studies and did not have girl friends to ask about problems. My Mom was working two jobs so I could go to college and I did not want to worry her. I just tried to ignore him, pretend it was not happening, and tried to do my work. It was the 1960s and there was no context to say anything. One day I went to the office and he swiveled in his chair and greeted me by wiggling a big banana which he was holding in his crotch. I ran away. When I calmed down, I told my advisor , who had arranged the project, that I did not know what to do - I did not want to disappoint him or create any awkwardness, but I was upset. (I later heard rumors that this professor recruited students for threesomes with his wife, also a professor. I recalled that a few times they both showed up at my dorm dining hall - he knew which dorm I was in - like they had been waiting for me and then invited themselves to have dinner with me. It seemed odd at the time ... but it might have meant nothing.)"female,social&humanities,Other R1,"My graduate school professor had long been mildly inappropriate with me (comments on my body, disparaging remarks about my partner, wanting to discuss sexual preferences) but I always laughed it - and the other rumors and complaints against him - off as him being my ""friendly grad school professor"".

We had been at a conference organized by the same agency once before and he'd been very supportive of my research then. He again expressed strong support for my research agenda, and we discussed it in great detail for over the next hour or two. Towards the end of the conversation, however, he began to ask personal questions. He asked me how old I was, if I had a boyfriend, invited me to drink with him in bars when I came to his city, and hugged me as we left the dinner. He may have been drunk because he nearly followed me into the women's bathroom before someone pointed out the correct way to the exit. I felt stunned and a little afraid.

What was really shocking was the part played by their senior female colleague, then Head of Teaching and my supervisor_验s wife's best friend, who became openly hostile towards me. It was so distressing and toxic that I became really depressed, and I went to the University's counselling service for advice, but they were no help at all._It actually got worse over the last two years of my programme, because my supervisor totally withdrew supervision - he put ridiculous conditions on meeting, ignored my emails, lied, gaslighted, belittled me and my work, and didn't read my thesis at all._I tried to get my second supervisor to take over, but she pulled away too, after speaking to Supervisor No. 1, and she didn't read my thesis in the months before submission either.

I'm so traumatised and angry. But the fact is that in that situation you have to focus every ounce of survival on getting the PhD.
